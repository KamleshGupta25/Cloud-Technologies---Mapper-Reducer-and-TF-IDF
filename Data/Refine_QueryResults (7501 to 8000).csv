I did once grab the source code to fix stuff like that, but never got the time. I also found it behaved oddly whenever there was a brief network disconnect (e.g. xDSL flapping) and it would reconnect to the wrong session (usually a new one) and leave the session I had opened in a disconnected state on the server. Otherwise Terminals would've been really cool, we have 200+ windows servers, and organising all those .rdp files can be a pain.</p>

I have to write a custom converter, because Microsoft.JScript.JSObject doesn't support IDictionary, so it gets treated as an array. I have this part working fine. However, because Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject is a subclass of Microsoft.JScript.JSObject, it also trys to convert it using the same method. How can I return something that will be serialized as a JSON array? I have to return an IDictionary, which will become a JSON object. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>Specifically, how do I return something from Serialize that gets serialized as an Array, not as an Object.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I guess I need to be more specific.</p>

<p>Microsoft.JScript.JSObject implements IEnumerable, but not IDictionary. Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject is a subclass of Microsoft.JScript.JSObject. If I create a .asmx in JScript.NET, when I try to return a JSObject, it gets serialized as an array (because it implements IEnumerable, but not IDictionary), which means that only the property names in the object get serialized. Of course, If I hand back an ArrayObject, it works properly, and serializes it as an array.</p>

<p>So, I implemented a subclass of JavascriptConverter, which says that its SupportedType is Microsoft.JScript.JSObject. Now, JSObjects get properly serialized. However, because ArrayObject is a subclass of JSObject, JavascriptSerializer no longer takes care of serializing ArrayObjects itself, it hands it off to the JSObject serializer. The question is, how does my custom serializer return something that the JavaScriptSerializer will properly treat as an array, not as an object -- Serialize is forced to return an IDictionary, and that gets serialized as an object, not an array.</p>

<p>Does this question make more sense?</p>

<p>BTW: I've looked at WCF and C# instead, but the DataContractJsonSerializer output is completely useless unless you're going to only ever access it using a WCF client; I'm planning to retrieve it using jQuery.</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<p>I finally understood what bdukes was trying to say, and it works! You need to tell it it's an array when returning the dictionary (although this won't work for a top-level array). Here is the <code>Serialize</code> function that I would up writing:</p>

<pre><code>   public override IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; Serialize (object obj, JavaScriptSerializer serializer) {
        JSObject jsobj = obj as JSObject;
        Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; netdict = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();

        if (jsobj != null) {
            foreach (string prop in jsobj) {
                object value = jsobj.GetField(prop, BindingFlags.Default).GetValue(jsobj);
                switch (value.GetType().FullName) {
                    case ""Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject"":
                        object[] arr_obj = ((IEnumerable)(Microsoft.JScript.ArrayObject)value).Cast&lt;object&gt;().ToArray&lt;object&gt;();
                        netdict.Add(prop, arr_obj);
                        break;
                    default:
                        netdict.Add(prop, value);
                        break;
                }
            }
        }
        return netdict;
    }

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Sorry, I guess I wasn't entirely clear.  I'd like to disable all of the submit buttons when someone clicks a submit button.  But I <strong>do</strong> need to send along the value of the submit button so the server knows which button I clicked, hence the insert call.  (Note: insert does <a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org/api/element/insert"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>not</strong></a> create a child of the element you call it on.)  And then after disabling the submit buttons I need to call the containing form of the submit buttons submit call, as IE will not submit after you disable the button.  Does that make sense?</p>

I'm developing on XP and the Sharepoint object model is not remotable.  This means any code which has ""using Microsoft.Sharepoint"" is out :-(
I'm looked into the CopyIntoItems web service but am having trouble implementing it myself.  I was hoping for a clear tutorial.

Also, since I can't use ""Microsoft.Sharepoint"" references, I'm wondering what my Fields will look like?  (Is this my metadata?)  Also, I'm curious as to why only Website projects allow me to add a web service.
Once the file is ""in"" Sharepoint using that web service, I'll have to use another one to update custom columns, or metadata.  Some of these are freeform text, but other must match entries in lists or lookups.  I haven't found any information on this yet.</p>

When running my program under the vs debugger, the debugger does not break on an unhandled exception.  Instead control is returned to VS as if the program exited normally.  If I look in the output tab, There is a first-chance exeption listed just before the thread termination.</p>

<p>I understand how to use the ""Exceptions"" box from the Debug menu.  I have the break on unhandled exceptions checked.  If I check first-chance exceptions for the specific exeption that is occuring, the debugger will stop.</p>

<p>However, it is my understanding that the debugger should also stop on any 'Unhandled-Exceptions'.  It is not doing this for me.</p>

<p>Here are the last few lines of my Output tab:</p>

<pre><code>A first chance exception of type 'System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException' occurred in mscorlib.dll
The thread 0x60c has exited with code 0 (0x0).

<p>I don't understand why the exception is flagges as a ""first chance"" exception when it is unhandled.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Within xhtml mode you can not use sytleId inside a html:form tag. It is not a problem since the id property is automatically generated to store your bean's name.</p>

I'd like to start with some simple prototypes on my development box which is running Vista Ultimate.  I'm not connected to a corporate network where I can just use an exchange server someplace.</p>

<p>I realize that there are several smtp servers that I can install, but I'm not sure what to do once I install one.  I know how to write the code to send the email, but I don't know what kind of configuration needs to be done to use the smtp server.</p>

<p>What I'd like is a clear description of what to do once I get an smtp server installed on my Vista box.  </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE:  I downloaded this smtp server: <a href=""http://softstack.com/freesmtp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://softstack.com/freesmtp.html</a></p>

<p>Here's what my code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Program

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        MailMessage message = new MailMessage();    
        message.From = new MailAddress(""tad@myconsoleapp.com"");

        message.Subject = ""This is my subject"";    
        message.Body = ""This is the content"";    
        SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(""localhost"");    
        client.Send(message);    
        Console.ReadLine();     
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I have this smtp server running and I execute my console app, it hands on the client.send line.  The smtp server looks like this:</p>

<p>It's important to note that it works fine for most controls - ellipses, rectangles, ink presenters, and also the Image control so long as I use a stream source rather than a uri source.</p>

<p>Edit: to give a bit more detail this is not about encrypting a message but a database table column where the plain text length happens to be 16 bytes. The data is not totally random (the first 8 bytes will frequently be the same) and there is a checksum to identify a successful decryption.</p>

<p>I'm going into a meeting with the guys proposing this next week and, if there is a problem, would greatly appreciate some pointers to reference material with which I can show that the design is insecure.

<p>Let's say I have a simple set of classes like this: </p>

<pre><code>class Bus
{
    Driver busDriver = new Driver();
}

class Driver
{
    Shoe[] shoes = { new Shoe(), new Shoe() };
}

class Shoe
{
    Shoelace lace = new Shoelace();
}

class Shoelace
{
    bool tied = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>Bus</code> has a <code>Driver</code>, the <code>Driver</code> has two <code>Shoe</code>s, each <code>Shoe</code> has a <code>Shoelace</code>. All very silly.  </p>

<h2>Add an IDisposable object to Shoelace</h2>

<p>Later I decide that some operation on the <code>Shoelace</code> could be multi-threaded, so I add an <code>EventWaitHandle</code> for the threads to communicate with. So <code>Shoelace</code> now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Shoelace
{
    private AutoResetEvent waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent(false);
    bool tied = false;
    // ... other stuff ..
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Implement IDisposable on Shoelace</h2>

<p>But now <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"" rel=""noreferrer"">Microsoft's FxCop</a> will complain: <em>""Implement IDisposable on 'Shoelace' because it creates members of the following IDisposable types: 'EventWaitHandle'.""</em></p>

<p>Okay, I implement <code>IDisposable</code> on <code>Shoelace</code> and my neat little class becomes this horrible mess:</p>

<pre><code>class Shoelace : IDisposable
{
    private AutoResetEvent waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent(false);
    bool tied = false;
    private bool disposed = false;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    ~Shoelace()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!this.disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                if (waitHandle != null)
                {
                    waitHandle.Close();
                    waitHandle = null;
                }
            }
            // No unmanaged resources to release otherwise they'd go here.
        }
        disposed = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or (as pointed out by commenters) since <code>Shoelace</code> itself has no unmanaged resources, I might use the simpler dispose implementation without needing the <code>Dispose(bool)</code> and Destructor:</p>

<pre><code>class Shoelace : IDisposable
{
    private AutoResetEvent waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent(false);
    bool tied = false;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (waitHandle != null)
        {
            waitHandle.Close();
            waitHandle = null;
        }
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Watch in horror as IDisposable spreads</h2>

<p>Right that's that fixed. But now FxCop will complain that <code>Shoe</code> creates a <code>Shoelace</code>, so <code>Shoe</code> must be <code>IDisposable</code> too. </p>

<p>The model stuff is fairly easy, I just have to include the module at the beginning, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Iso &lt; Sale
  include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension
  include Shared::OrderLines
  extend  Shared::Filtered
  include Sendable::Model

  validates_presence_of   :customer
  validates_associated    :lines

  owned_by :customer

  def initialize( params = nil )
    super
    self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date
  end

  def after_initialize
  end

  order_lines             :despatched

  # tracks_serial_numbers   :items
  sendable :customer

  def created_at=( date )
    write_attribute( :created_at, Chronic.parse( date ) )
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is working fine, now however, I'm going to have some controller and view code that's going to be common between these models as well, so far I have this for my sendable stuff:</p>

<pre><code># This is a module that is used for pages/forms that are can be ""sent""
# either via fax, email, or printed.
module Sendable
  module Model
    def self.included( klass )
      klass.extend ClassMethods
    end

    module ClassMethods
      def sendable( class_to_send_to )
        attr_accessor :fax_number,
                      :email_address,
                      :to_be_faxed,
                      :to_be_emailed,
                      :to_be_printed

        @_class_sending_to ||= class_to_send_to

        include InstanceMethods
      end

      def class_sending_to
        @_class_sending_to
      end
    end # ClassMethods

    module InstanceMethods
      def after_initialize( )
        super
        self.to_be_faxed    = false
        self.to_be_emailed  = false
        self.to_be_printed  = false

        target_class = self.send( self.class.class_sending_to )
        if !target_class.nil?
          self.fax_number     = target_class.send( :fax_number )
          self.email_address  = target_class.send( :email_address )
        end
      end
    end
  end # Module Model
end # Module Sendable
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I'm planning on just doing an include Sendable::Controller, and Sendable::View (or the equivalent) for the controller and the view, but, is there a cleaner way to do this?  I 'm after a neat way to have a bunch of common code between my model, controller, and view.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to clarify, this just has to be shared across 2 or 3 models.</p>

<ul>
<li>A SQL Server view that accesses the Oracle database using OPENROWSET works perfectly, so I know I have valid connection string parameters.  However, the new requirement is for extremely dynamic Oracle queries that depend on client-side selections, and I haven't been able to get dynamic (or even parameterized) Oracle queries to work from SQL Server views or stored procedures.</li>
<li>Client-side access to the SQL Server database works perfectly with dynamic and parameterized queries.</li>
<li>I cannot count on clients having any Oracle client software.  Therefore, access to the Oracle database has to be through the SQL Server database, using views, stored procedures, or dynamic queries using OPENROWSET.</li>
<li>Because the SQL Server database is on a shared server, I'm not allowed to use globally-linked databases.</li>
</ul>

<p>My idea was to define a function that would take my own version of a parameterized Oracle query, make the parameter substitutions, wrap the query in an OPENROWSET, and execute it in SQL Server, returning the resulting recordset.  Here's sample code:</p>

<pre><code>// db is a global variable containing an ADODB.Connection opened to the SQL Server DB
// rs is a global variable containing an ADODB.Recordset
. . .
ss = ""SELECT myfield FROM mytable WHERE {param0} ORDER BY myfield;"";
OracleQuery(ss,[""somefield='"" + somevalue + ""'""]);
. . .
function OracleQuery(sql,params) {
  var s = sql;
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; params.length; i++) s = s.replace(""{param"" + i + ""}"",params[i]);
  var e = ""SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET('MSDAORA','(connect-string-values)';""
    + ""'user';'pass','"" + s.split(""'"").join(""''"") + ""') q"";
  try {
    rs.Open(""EXEC ('"" + e.split(""'"").join(""''"") + ""')"",db);
  } catch (eobj) {
    alert(""SQL ERROR: "" + eobj.description + ""\nSQL: "" + e);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The SQL error that I'm getting is <code>Ad hoc access to OLE DB provider 'MSDAORA' has been denied.  You must access this provider through a linked server.</code> which makes no sense to me.  The Microsoft explanation for this error relates to a registry setting (<code>DisallowAdhocAccess</code>).  This is set correctly on my PC, but surely this relates to the DB server and not the client PC, and I would expect that the setting there is correct since the view mentioned above works.</p>

<p>One alternative that I've tried is to eliminate the enclosing EXEC in the Open statement:</p>

<pre><code>rs.Open(e,db);
</code></pre>

<p>but this generates the same error.  </p>

<p>I also tried putting the OPENROWSET in a stored procedure.  This works perfectly when executed from within SQL Server Management Studio, but fails with the same error message when the stored procedure is called from Javascript.</p>

<p>Is what I'm trying to do possible?  If so, can you recommend how to fix my code?  Or is a completely different approach necessary?</p>

<p>Any hints or related information will be welcome.  Thanks in advance.</p>

The closest I got was to save a file to .SVG and use Inkscape to convert it to XAML.  All lines and such converted nicely, but all the text was just a pile of text on top of the document.  I also tried importing the DXF to Adobe Illustrator and using Mike Swansons AI to XAML export plugin, but that didn't work on my files.  I just says something like ""unable to save"".</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I've tested Visio, I was unable to make it read a single DXF file.  Eventually I downloaded AutoCAD LT, made a drawing with 2 lines, a box and some text.  Saved it to all available formats and tried to import all files into Visio.  No go.  I really wonder how Visio can claim it supports DXF files.</p>

<p>I've tested 3D PaintBrush, and as I suspected it only worked on 3D models.  My drawings are simple 2D drawings with some lines, boxes, paths and some text.</p>

<p>I feel quite sure Zam 3D will also only import 3D objects, but I am going to test it (even if I think I have tried it earlier).</p>

<p>Most of the links to conversion tools are outdated, and the few that remains are 3D tools.  I was able to convert a PDF document today, but that also just exported the text as paths and not text objects (which I really need).</p>

<p>I also looked into BAML (Binary Xaml), and it seems that the support for creating and working with BAML will be quite good in .Net 4, as it is pratically non-existing in 3.5.  But I suppose that if I manage to convert the files propely they will be small enough to handle as XAML files (the ones I've tried now converts to 3.5 mb and loads really slowly).</p>

<p>Since I don't have a mentor, I was wondering if anyone can suggest a book or website that guides beginner programmers through building a (somewhat) real .NET application as a way to teach them the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>P (Person) objects are usually Holders of Positions (S).</p>

<p>There is the S-S relationship model, which I am told is called Supervisory model.  That is each Position reports to another position, and one of the positions is considered a manager.</p>

<p>There is another model whose name I am trying to locate, where the structure of Organizational reporting is between O objects first, in a tree structure.  At each node, the S objects belong to the O object, with one of them flagged as the Manager.  </p>

<p>No doubt there are other models, and if you know what they are called, and how they work, that would be very useful!  </p>

<p>My perspective on this question is while trying to implement a Novell Identity Manager driver from SAP HR into an eDirectory identity vault, from there to provision users into Active Directory and Lotus Notes.</p>

<p>One of the key drivers for the project is the manager and directReports structure, so that Managers can all be identified, and the reporting structure visualized. Thus the importance of the SAP HR relationship modelling.</p>

1.) A call to a web service method <br />
2.) A call to a database</p>

<p>For example, assume that you have a simple web service that just returns an integer that is calculated in X time. You also have a database that, when queried in th right way, also takes X time to calculate the answer. (So the <strong>compute time is the same in both cases</strong>) In both cases, assume the amount of data both directions is the same, say, a single 32-bit integer, for simplicity.</p>

<p>Thus far, the calculation times of both the web service and the database are exactly the same.</p>

<p>The environment is 1 application server, where the app resides, and 1 other server that is holding both the web service and the database. There is nothing else going on in the environment other than the application calling either the web service or database repeatedly. <strong>This all within one single LAN</strong>, so any network latency is equal.</p>

<p>From an application, which will be faster, the call to the database, or the call to the web service?</p>

<p>What I am trying to isolate, I guess, is which is more heavy-weight. Does the set up, open, close, tear down of a database connection end up slower than that for a web service,   or is it the same? Additionally, if there are other things, such as parsing the result from a web service, how do they affect the speed?</p>

<li><p>with the previous example the ""room"" is an ascx rendered either by a renderpartial or an ajax call via jquery. what is the best way for the controller to pass the selectlist so the ascx can use it, currently I add to the viewdata for the page, which passes it's viewdata to the renderpartial, but then on the ajax call the action method also needs to add the selectlist to the Viewdata for the ascx, agan not sure this is the best way.</p></li>
<li><p>I have a repository that holds this ""static"" data and returns as a generic list, so each time the controller needs the data it hits the repository for the list (there are a few more than just board rate, things like titles for people, mr, mrs etc and others) I suspect some kind of cache would be better as the data rarely if ever changes.</p></li>

<p>Here is my case: I have some value type which is wrapped into another type with appropriate implicit converters. If I cast wrapped type to an object and then try to get original value I can do that in two-step cast only. 
If simplified my code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public enum MyEnum : int
    {
        First,
        Second
    }


    public class Test&lt;T&gt;
    {
        public Test(T val)
        {
            Value = val;
        }

        private T Value { get; set; }


        public static implicit operator T(Test&lt;T&gt; m)
        {
            return m.Value;
        }

        public static implicit operator Test&lt;T&gt;(T m)
        {
            var res = new Test&lt;T&gt;(m);
            return res;
        }
    }


    static void Main()
    {
        object res = new Test&lt;MyEnum&gt;(MyEnum.First);
        Console.WriteLine((MyEnum)(Test&lt;MyEnum&gt;)res);
        Console.WriteLine((MyEnum)res);
    }

<p>Is there any way I can modify this behavior and get it working without double casting?</p>

<p>That handler will run during Ajax requests (as a result of the Ajax framework I am using), as well as at other times - the condition of the if statement filters out non-Ajax events, and works just fine (it isn't relevant here, so I didn't include it for brevity's sake).</p>

<p>It suffices us to say that this works just fine - the cookie is set, I am able to read it on the client, and all is well up to that point.</p>

<pre><code>function deleteCookie(name) {
   var cookieDate = new Date();
   cookieDate.setTime(cookieDate.getTime() - 1);

<pre><code>Math.Round(1.23456, 4); // returns 1.2346
</code></pre>

<p>However, I want to round a number such that the fractional part of the number rounds to the closest fractional part of a predefined fraction (e.g. 1/8th) and I'm trying to find out if the .NET library already has this built in.</p>

<p>So, for example, if I want to round a decimal number to a whole eighth then I'd want to call something like:</p>

<pre><code>Math.RoundFractional(1.9, 8); // and have this yield 1.875
Math.RoundFractional(1.95, 8); // and have this yield 2.0
</code></pre>

<p>So the first param is the number that I want to round and the second param dictates the rounding fraction. So in this example, after rounding has taken place the figures following the decimal point can only be one of eight values: .000, .125, .250, .375, .500, .625, .750, .875</p>

But they all refer to running <code>devenv /setup</code> which doesn't seem to be available for Visual Web Developer 2008 Express. Has anyone gotten the Create Unit Test Project dialog working with NUnit and VWD Express? How so?</p>

Ideally, just the letters would get squished or made thinner, leaving the space between words more or less the same. I know there are some CSS attributes that do things like this, but they are more focused on spacing between the letters and not so much on the widths of the letters themselves. These CSS methods are also not very cross-browser friendly. The majority of the user base is using IE6, so that puts a large restriction on CSS-based methods out of the blocks.</p>

<p>So, is there any way to control the character width/spacing that is cross-browser friendly? I know jQuery works across browsers quite well, so could this perhaps be done with jQuery by manipulating the location of the letters and possibly their widths? These are small bits of text, 5 words at a time, or so, so speed is something that can be dealt with later.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Ok, so, the CSS letter-spacing property, as well as the word-spacing property will allow me to control the space between letters/words. However, this makes things look squished. If this truly is the only option, then I'll have to make it work, but what I am really looking for is a way to squish the letters themselves, to make the characters thinner.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head:</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of Self-hosting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Flexibility. On my own machine I can install whatever I want. If I would like to use a vcs like Bazaar and use Loggerhead instead of Trac, then right now there isn't really much choice beyond Launchpad, which has its warts  </li>
<li>Save money. Costs add up over time especially for large teams</li>
<li>The free plans offered by sites like Assembla are not private. Anybody can have access to your code</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages of Paid hosting (ie: GitHub, Assembla, Google Code)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Robustness. You don't need to worry about your server catching fire because it's become somebody else's problem.</li>
<li>Less hassle. Don't need to be do all the system administration and tweaking of conf files. Instead you can just focus on the coding</li>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"" 
                      ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd""&gt;

        &lt;img class=""foo"" src=""bar.png""/&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If I parse the document using lxml.html, I can get the IMG with an xpath just fine:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; root = lxml.html.fromstring(doc)
&gt;&gt;&gt; root.xpath(""//img"")
[&lt;Element img at 1879e30&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I parse the document as XML and try to get the IMG tag, I get an empty result:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tree = etree.parse(StringIO(doc))
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.getroot().xpath(""//img"")
[]
</code></pre>

<p>I can navigate to the element directly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.getroot().getchildren()[1].getchildren()[0]
&lt;Element {http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img at f56810&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But of course that doesn't help me process arbitrary documents.  I would also expect to be able to query etree to get an xpath expression that will directly identify this element, which, technically I can do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.getpath(tree.getroot().getchildren()[1].getchildren()[0])
'/*/*[2]/*'
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.getroot().xpath('/*/*[2]/*')
[&lt;Element {http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}img at fa1750&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>But that xpath is, again, obviously not useful for parsing arbitrary documents.</p>

<p>Obviously I am missing some key issue here, but I don't know what it is.  My best guess is that it has something to do with namespaces but the only namespace defined is the default and I don't know what else I might need to consider in regards to namespaces.</p>

The database engine is a lot more advanced, but the management studio is pretty awful in a number of ways.  Most of our developers decided they preferred to stick with the old Query Analyzer tool, even though it had a lot of limitations.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I decided to write a replacement for Query Analyzer / Management Studio that did the things our developers most needed to do.  I finally got permission to release it for free: Versabanq Squel (versabanq.com/squel).</p>

<p>Like I said, it's free, so this isn't a sales pitch.  But it got me thinking.  What I'm wondering is: are most of you satisfied with SQL Studio the way it is?  Do people just use it because it's what Microsoft pushes on them?  Are there many people out there looking for something better?  Maybe I can get some support for long-term development of this, if it looks like there might be some wider interest.</p>

I want to give users a form to upload an image when they post information about a room.  I've written code that works, but I'm afraid I've done it the hard way, and specifically in a way that violates DRY.</p>

<p>Was hoping someone who's a little more familiar with django forms could point out where I've gone wrong. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've tried to clarify why I chose this design in comments to the current answers.  To summarize: </p>

<p>I didn't simply put an <code>ImageField</code> on the <code>Room</code> model because I wanted more than one image associated with the Room model.  I chose a generic Image model because I wanted to add images to several different models.  The alternatives I considered were were multiple foreign keys on a single <code>Image</code> class, which seemed messy, or multiple <code>Image</code> classes, which I thought would clutter my schema.  I didn't make this clear in my first post, so sorry about that.</p>

<p>Seeing as none of the answers so far has addressed how to make this a little more DRY I did come up with my own solution which was to add the upload path as a class attribute on the image model and reference that every time it's needed.</p>

<pre><code># Models
class Image(models.Model):
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()

    image = models.ImageField(_('Image'),

                                width_field='',
                                upload_to='uploads/images',
                                max_length=200)
class Room(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    image_set = generic.GenericRelation('Image') 

# The form
class AddRoomForm(forms.ModelForm):
    image_1 = forms.ImageField()

    class Meta:
        model = Room

# The view
def handle_uploaded_file(f):

    # DRY violation, I've already specified the upload path in the image model
    upload_suffix = join('uploads/images', f.name)
    upload_path = join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, upload_suffix)
    destination = open(upload_path, 'wb+')
    for chunk in f.chunks():
        destination.write(chunk)
    destination.close()
    return upload_suffix

def add_room(request, apartment_id, form_class=AddRoomForm, template='apartments/add_room.html'):
    apartment  = Apartment.objects.get(id=apartment_id)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = form_class(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            room = form.save()
            image_1 = form.cleaned_data['image_1']

            # Instead of writing a special function to handle the image, 
            # shouldn't I just be able to pass it straight into Image.objects.create
            # ...but it doesn't seem to work for some reason, wrong syntax perhaps?

            upload_path = handle_uploaded_file(image_1)
            image = Image.objects.create(content_object=room, image=upload_path)
            return HttpResponseRedirect(room.get_absolute_url())
    else:
        form = form_class()

<li>Why it doesn't iterate to the end of the array?</li>
<li>According to the description in the link above the loop should be broken out of when the squareroot of the last element in the array is greater than the current prime - mine does this one before.  </li>

<p>I'm fairly sure it has something to do with the delete operation modifying the length of the array. For example my function currently yields 2,3,5,7,9,10 when I enter n=10 which is obviously not correct.

<p>Many times important warnings have gone unnoticed because, people got used to having a gazillion useless warnings pass by, so they obviously just stop looking at them carefully, and with reason IMHO. One could say in our case GCC is crying wolf too much for anyone to take it seriously anymore, which is a bad attitude but its just human nature. </p>

<p>Right now we compile with <code>-Wall</code>, because we want warnings, but is there a counter flag to avoid the new-line warnings?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In response to Robert Gamble's totally reasonable solution, our code is cross-platform and we have people and builds on Linux, Solaris and Windows, so the new-line... is not under consensus.

<p>I can't get it at all... instance of class DBClass was just created, but class cannot be loaded.
<strong>then I've tried to place this code in simple java application (not eclipse rcp) and all went ok.</strong> so I think some Eclipse part blocking class loading.</p>

<p>also i've tried to load class before calling terms.next();</p>

<p>...and got same error. Class can not be loaded.

<p>Suppose I have input like this:</p>

<pre><code>Some text %interestingbit% lots of random text lots and lots more %anotherinterestingbit%
Some text %interestingbit% lots of random text OPTIONAL_THING lots and lots more %anotherinterestingbit%
Some text %interestingbit% lots of random text lots and lots more %anotherinterestingbit%

<p>There are many repeating blocks in the input and in each block I want to capture some things that are always there (%interestingbit% and %anotherinterestingbit%), but there is also a bit of text that may or may not occur in-between them (OPTIONAL_THING) and I want to capture it if it's there.</p>

<p>A RegEx like this matches only blocks with OPTIONAL_THING in it (and the named capture works):</p>

<pre><code>%interestingbit%.+?((?&lt;OptionalCapture&gt;OPTIONAL_THING)).+?%anotherinterestingbit%
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems like it's just a matter of making the whole group optional, right? That's what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>%interestingbit%.+?((?&lt;OptionalCapture&gt;OPTIONAL_THING))?.+?%anotherinterestingbit%
</code></pre>

<p>But I find that although this matches all 3 blocks the named capture (OptionalCapture) is empty in all of them! How do I get this to work?</p>

<p>Note that there can be a lot of text within each block, including newlines, which is why I put in "".+?"" rather than something more specific. I'm using .NET regular expressions, testing with The Regulator.</p>

<p>For security reasons, I'd like to avoid users having to give their passwords for our service to the 3rd party applications. (Perhaps this shouldn't be a big concern?)

<p>This made me think that OpenID might be a potential solution here.

The only ""fix"" I have found is to add float:left or right to the spans, but that defeats my original purpose of trying not to use floats at all. Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    span{
        border:2px solid #000;

        display:inline-block;

        padding:0;
        margin:0;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Test2&lt;/span&gt;

<pre><code>if(foo!=null){
  if(foo.getBar()!=null){
    Bar bar = foo.getBar();
    System.out.println(""Success: "" + bar);

<p>I handling now to ""failure"" -states independently, even if the outcome is the same. I could get them together like this:</p>

  System.out.println(""Success: "" + bar);

<p>Much neater code already. if foo is null it will stop there and won't try foo.getBar (in the if) so I won't get a NPE. The last thing i would like to enhance, and the main question: Do I really gave to call on foo.getBar() twice? It would be nice to get away from the second identical call if getBar() would be a very heavy operation. So I am wondering if there is somehow possible to do something similiar to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(foo!=null &amp;&amp; (Bar bar = foo.getBar())!=null){
  Bar bar = foo.getBar();
  System.out.println(""Success: "" + bar);

<p>Imagine you have a core widget class. It has a method <code>calculateHeight()</code>, that returns a height. The height is too big - this result in buttons (say) that are too big. You can extend DefaultWidget to create your own NiceWidget, and implement your own <code>calculateHeight()</code> to return a nicer size.</p>

<p>Now a library class WindowDisplayFactory, instantiates DefaultWidget in a fairly complex method. You would like it to use your NiceWidget. The factory class's method looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public IWidget createView(Component parent) {
    DefaultWidget widget = new DefaultWidget(CONSTS.BLUE, CONSTS.SIZE_STUPIDLY);

    // bunch of ifs ...
    SomeOtherWidget bla = new SomeOtherWidget(widget);
    SomeResultWidget result = new SomeResultWidget(parent);
    SomeListener listener = new SomeListener(parent, widget, flags);

    // more widget creation and voodoo here

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's the deal. The result has the DefaultWidget deep within a hierarchy of other objects. The question - how to get this factory method to use my own NiceWidget? Or at least get my own <code>calculateHeight()</code> in there. Ideally, I'd like to be able to monkey patch the DefaultWidget so that its calculateHeight did the right thing...</p>

<pre><code>public class MyWindowDisplayFactory {
    public IWidget createView(Component parent) {
        DefaultWidget.class.setMethod(""calculateHeight"", myCalculateHeight);
        return super.createView(parent);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is what I could do in Python, Ruby, etc. I've invented the name <code>setMethod()</code> though. The other options open to me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copying and pasting the code of the <code>createView()</code> method into my own class that inherits from the factory class</li>
<li>Living with widgets that are too big</li>
</ul>

<p>The factory class can't be changed - it is part of a core platform API. I tried reflection on the returned result to get to the widget that (eventually) got added, but it is several widget-layers down and somewhere it gets used to initialize other stuff, causing odd side effects.</p>

<p>Any ideas? My solution so far is the copy-paste job, but that's a cop out that requires tracking the changes in the parent factory class when upgrading to newer versions of the platform, and I'd be interested to hear other options.</p>

<p>I've seen other places where there's a workaround of conditionally hiding paragraphs based on some code, having 2 paragraphs with opposite hiding conditions, one with an editable field, the other with a computed field. However, I don't know enough about Notes to see how this is implemented (I can see it done on other forms, but there seem to be some 'magic' steps within Notes which I either can't see or don't get).</p>

<p>[EDIT]
The reply from Kerr seems to be what I'm looking for, but I still can't find out where the InputEnabled property is located. Should have said in the initial question, I'm using Notes 7.0.3.</p>

<p>In fairness, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are for when to enable/disable the field, it's just some boolean condition that is set, in my case only on form loading so I don't even have to worry about this changing dynamically while the form is displayed.</p>

<p>I've got a few issues with Notes, my largest bugbear being that it's so tied so tightly to the Designer UI, which is utter shite. I can do this sort of thing programmatically in most GUI languages (C#, Java, Delphi, even VB), but I need to open property boxes in Notes and set them correctly. </p>

<p>This would be OK as an <em>optional</em> method, but <em>forcing</em> you to go this way means you can only work as well as the IDE lets you in this case, and the IDE here seems to actively work against you. You can't open multiple functions/scripts, you can't swap from one script to another without going back to the menus on the left, you can't easily search the codebase for occurrences of variables/fields (and believe me, this is a major failing for me because either Notes or the internal codebase in my case seems to make a lot of use of global variables!), you can only work with fields through the property boxes that get displayed, you can't edit code in Designer while debugging through the main Notes client. </p>

<p>While the Java side of the coding is better than LotusScript, it's still fairly crappy (why can't you debug INTO Java code?? Why do you need to re-import JAR files for each Java class, does each class have a different CLASSPATH???). Possibly this was improved in Notes 8, I hear it's based on Eclipse. Does anyone know whether this is true or not?</p>

<p>So far, so boring - exactly what I'd expect to happen.</p>

<p>When I run it against query #2, nothing happens - the ""do something useful"" section is never reached.</p>

<p><em>Now here's where things get a bit more interesting...</em></p>

<p>If I remove the <code>HasRows</code> check then everything works as expected - the ""do something useful"" section gets hit for each of the 20 rows, regardless of which query is used.</p>

<p>It seems that the <code>HasRows</code> property isn't populated correctly if SQL Server generates a message. The results are returned and can be iterated through using the <code>Read()</code> method but the <code>HasRows</code> property will be false.</p>

<p>Andy, thx for answer, though I'm myself was thinking that it should act that way.
I ckecked your simple variant and it works. Though I have a similar example and it didn't worked. The only difference was that in template I used my UserControl that have TextBlock and other controls inside the StackPanel inside it's Content Property. And after hour of experimenting with Width, HorizontalAlignment and so on in different part of the code I understand, that I can do nothing.
And then - i just changed StackPanel with Grid. And - viola! - it works. I don't know if it's a bug or just some specific reaction of StackPanel (actually I checked it parameters in run-time - and it was very strange: ActualWidth was more then the DesiredSize and real width of the Panel). So if someone could tell me - why is this so? - it would be interesting. If no - i'll just use version with Grid.</p>

<p>I mentioned in the past thread that I thought immutability is the process of making an object read only and giving it low visibility.

<p>What exactly is the definition of state in the case of this example? State is a concept which I haven't really grasped.</p>

<p>From a design guideline perspective, an immutable class must be one which does not accept user input and really would just return values?</p>

<p>My understanding is that any object which just returns information should be immutable and ""locked down"", right? So if I want to return the current time in a dedicated class with that one method, I should use a reference type as that will work a reference of the type and thus I benefit from immutability.</p>

<p>The SECOND issue has to do with modifying the existing layout so that there is a centered vertical area of 760px in width that displays in a shade of color different from the surrounding viewport.  The primary difficulty is that in order to get my footer to stick to the bottom in both browsers and resize with the viewport, I had to re-adopt a table layout.  The current strategy, however, is to use as few nests as possible in order to benefit from the speed and clarity from using DIVs.  I would opt to use a DIV layout to the exclusion of a TABLE layout if it were not for the apparently, currently insoluble problem of getting a working sticky-footer to work with a DIV liquid layout.</p>

<p>When running the new Nimbus LAF these fields are opaque (despite setting setOpaque(false)), and my UI is broken.  It's as if the LAF is ignoring the opaque property.  Setting a background color <strike>explicitly is both difficult in several places, and less than optimal due to background images</strike> actually doesn't work - it still paints it's LAF default background over the top, leaving a border-like appearance (the splash screen below has the background explicitly set to match the image).</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I can get Nimbus to not paint the background for a JTextField?</p>

<p>Note: I need a JTextField, rather than a JLabel, because I need the thread-safe setText(), and wrapping capability.</p>

<p>Note: My fallback position is to continue using the system LAF, but Nimbus does look substantially better.</p>

<p>See example images below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The <em>surprise</em> at this behavior is due to a misinterpretation of what setOpaque() is meant to do - from the Nimbus bug report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a problem the the orginal design of Swing and how it has been confusing for years. The issue is setOpaque(false) has had a side effect in exiting LAFs which is that of hiding the background which is not really what it is ment for. It is ment to say that the component my have transparent parts and swing should paint the parent component behind it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's unfortunate that the Nimbus components also appear not to honor setBackground(null) which would otherwise be the recommended way to stop the background painting.  Setting a fully transparent background seems unintuitive to me.</p>

<p>In my opinion, setOpaque()/isOpaque() is a faulty public API choice which should have been only:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean isFullyOpaque();
</code></pre>

<p>I say this, because isOpaque()==true is a contract with Swing that the component subclass will take responsibility for painting it's entire background - which means the parent can skip painting that region if it wants (which is an important performance enhancement). Something external cannot <em>directly</em> change this contract (legitimately), whose fulfillment may be coded into the component.  </p>

<p>So the opacity of the component should not have been settable using setOpaque().  Instead something like setBackground(null) should cause many components to ""not have a background"" and therefore become not fully opaque.  By way of example, in an ideal world most components should have an isOpaque() that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean isOpaque() { return (background!=null); }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm writing an eclipse editor plugin for a custom file format (specifically, the ""snake file format"" of the Shark3D game engine). I have implemented a scanner to get syntax highlighting, and an outline. </p>

<li>For the underlines, do I simply have the scanner return an <code>IToken</code> with a ""wriggly underline"" <code>TextAttribute</code> instead of the normal one, or is there a specific mechanism for marking syntax errors? </li>
<li>How do I implement the scrollbar markers? Is <code>IAnnotationModel</code> the relevant interface here? If so, where do I register the implementation so that the markers appear? </li>

<p><a href=""http://forum.codecall.net/php-tutorials/2014-simple-register-login-logoff-system.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Beginner Simple Register-Login system</a></p>

<p>There seems to be an issue with both login and register pages.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

function register_form(){ 

$date = date('D, M, Y'); 
echo ""&lt;form action='?act=register' method='post'&gt;""

} 

function register(){ 

$connect = mysql_connect(""host"", ""username"", ""password""); 
if(!$connect){ 
die(mysql_error());
} 

$select_db = mysql_select_db(""database"", $connect); 
if(!$select_db){ 
die(mysql_error()); 
} 

$username = $_REQUEST['username']; 
$password = $_REQUEST['password']; 
$pass_conf = $_REQUEST['password_conf']; 
$email = $_REQUEST['email']; 
$date = $_REQUEST['date']; 


if(empty($username)){ 
die(""Please enter your username!&lt;br&gt;""); 
} 

if(empty($password)){ 
die(""Please enter your password!&lt;br&gt;"");

if(empty($pass_conf)){

} 

if(empty($email)){ 
die(""Please enter your email!""); 
} 


$user_check = mysql_query(""SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='$username'""); 
$do_user_check = mysql_num_rows($user_check); 


$email_check = mysql_query(""SELECT email FROM users WHERE email='$email'""); 
$do_email_check = mysql_num_rows($email_check); 


if($do_user_check &gt; 0){ 
die(""Username is already in use!&lt;br&gt;""); 
} 

if($do_email_check &gt; 0){ 
die(""Email is already in use!""); 
} 


if($password != $pass_conf){ 
die(""Passwords don't match!""); 
} 


$insert = mysql_query(""INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES      ('$username', '$password', '$email')""); 
if(!$insert){ 
die(""There's little problem: "".mysql_error()); 
} 

echo $username."", you are now registered. Thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=login.php&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt; |     &lt;a href=index.php&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;""; 

} 

switch($act){ 

default; 
register_form(); 
break; 

case ""register""; 
register(); 
break; 

} 

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Once pressed the register button the page does nothing, fields are erased and no data is added inside the database or error given.
I tought that the problem might be the <code>switch($act){</code> part so I removed it and changed the page using a <code>require</code></p>

<pre><code>require('connect.php');
</code></pre>

<p>where connect.php is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
mysql_connect(""localhost"",""host"",""password"");
mysql_select_db(""database"");
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Removed the <code>function register_form(){</code> and <code>echo</code> part turning it into an HTML code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action='register' method='post'&gt; 
Username: &lt;input type='text' name='username' size='30'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Password: &lt;input type='password' name='password' size='30'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Confirm your password: &lt;input type='password' name='password_conf' size='30'&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Email: &lt;input type='text' name='email' size='30'&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;input type='hidden' name='date' value='$date'&gt;
&lt;input type='submit' name=""register"" value='Register'&gt; 
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And instead of having a <code>function register(){</code> I replaced it with a <code>if($register){</code></p>

<p>So when the Register button is pressed it runs the php code, but this edit doesn't seem to work either. So what can the problem be? If needed I can re-add this code on my Domain</p>

<p>The login page has the same issue, nothing happens when the button is pressed beside emptying the fields.</p>

<p>In a nutshell you can drag a window by the title bar to the top of the screen to maximise it, drag it back down to restore and drag it to the left edge or the right edge of the screen to have it snap into position butted up against the edge you dragged it to, and resized to occupy half the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In reply to the answers of @Jon and @litb, and the comment of @Earwicker, I was thinking <code>Cloneable</code> might be:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Cloneable&lt;T&gt; {
    public T clone();

<p>Here <code>T clone();</code> overrides <code>Object.clone()</code>, giving it a covariant type. I believe this would still be backwards compatible and increase type safety. So why not?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> As can be seen in the answers (and comments) below, the interface suggested above would break backwards-compatibility. Since <code>Object.clone()</code> is <code>protected</code>, rewriting it in the interface would force all implementers to provide a <code>public</code> implementation, which class designers might not want to (i.e. they might opt to keep it <code>protected</code>).</p>

<p>To quote him directly, “For example, in the OO world you hear a good deal about ""patterns"". I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that
aren't powerful enough-- often that I'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.” </p>

<p>This issue is resolved in Vista-Vista comunication via DirectX 11 (?) but this will not be made available on XP.  There is obviously a performance hit here,  I would like to understand it before making any inroads into developing applications to WPF.</p>

<p>See comment from the above link (quote):</p>

<hr>

<p>To SpongeJim's question, this is done by the MIL (media integration layer), which is the underlying core of WPF that handles composition. On a Vista/Vista remote desktop connection, the MIL primitives are remoted and then reconstituted. On other combinations (e.g. 2003/XP), what gets remoted is bitmaps, which is obviously far more bandwidth-intensive.

<p>According to the <a href=""http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0_fr/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/system/LoaderContext.html#applicationDomain"" rel=""noreferrer"">documentation</a>, the <code>applicationDomain</code> property of <code>LoaderContext</code> is usable in an AIR application too, but it just seems to be not working.</p>

<p>I have the following code :</p>

<pre><code>package {
    import flash.display.Loader;
    import flash.display.LoaderInfo;
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import flash.events.Event;
    import flash.net.URLRequest;
    import flash.system.ApplicationDomain;
    import flash.system.LoaderContext;

    public class Invoker extends Sprite
    {
        private var _ldr : Loader;

        public function Invoker()
        {
            _ldr = new Loader();
            _ldr.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onChildOneComplete);

            var ldrC : LoaderContext = new LoaderContext(false,
                new ApplicationDomain(ApplicationDomain.currentDomain)
            );

            _ldr.load(new URLRequest(""otherSwf.swf""), ldrC);
        }

        private function onChildOneComplete(e : Event) : void
        {
            var c1ad : ApplicationDomain = (e.target as LoaderInfo).applicationDomain;
            var inad : ApplicationDomain = ApplicationDomain.currentDomain;

            trace(""Child One parentDomain : "" + c1ad.parentDomain);
            trace(""Invoker parentDomain   : "" + inad.parentDomain);

            trace(""Child One has Invoker  : "" + c1ad.hasDefinition(""Invoker""));
            trace(""Invoker has Invoker    : "" + inad.hasDefinition(""Invoker""));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compiling this code as an SWF file and launching it with the Flash Player does this output, which seems right :</p>

<pre><code>Child One parentDomain : [object ApplicationDomain]
Invoker parentDomain   : null
Child One has Invoker  : true
Invoker has Invoker    : true
</code></pre>

<p>But the same code as an AIR application does a different output :</p>

<pre><code>Child One parentDomain : null
Invoker parentDomain   : null
Child One has Invoker  : false
Invoker has Invoker    : true
</code></pre>

<p>According to the documentation, the first output (using a SWF with Flash Player, and not an AIR application) is the right one. Also, playing around with this snippet and changing the application domain to others possible configurations (like <code>new ApplicationDomain(null)</code>, or <code>ApplicationDomain.currentDomain</code>) does exaclty what the documentation says with the SWF, but does not change the output of the AIR application.</p>

<p>Any clue why AIR is simply ignoring the application domain passed to the loader context ? Any documentation about this particular issue ?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>In response to Lou Franco (and gacutil):</p>

<p>I'm using Gacutil for development, but it seems to me to be not the proper way to install it, since gacutil isn't included in the basic .NET utilities past .NET 1.1 - it's only a developer tool.</p>

<p>Additional: Gacutil (as seen in responses below) is not redistributable, and therefore should not be used in any app that you intend to give to people who are not developers.  AKA, customers.  See <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/11/04/why-to-not-use-gacutil-exe-in-an-application-setup.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">This blog post (and comments) by Aaron Stebner</a>.</p>

<p>In response to using WIX:</p>

<p>WIX might be great and all, but how does it work under the hood?  What details makes the way WIX installs the assembly the right way to install it?  How does it look it up?  Is it a system/.NET call?  Is there some call in a dll buried somewhere in System32 that needs to be made?  </p>

<p>(Edit: it looks like WIX uses MSI under the hood.  See my comments in the accepted answer.)</p>

<p>Final edit: It looks like the correct way to install an assembly to the GAC is using windows installer, and nothing else.  I'm going to give Wix a try.  Thanks all!</p>

@Nick - I tried your suggestion of explictly setting the address of each endpoint with the fully qualified path of each server and I still get the same result.</p>

<p>Also, when I try to set the listenUri attribute with the shared site URL, I get a 400 bad request error instead of a 404 error.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b><br />
After some additional research, there were some IIS configuration setting conflicts between <a href=""http://apps1.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps1.mydomain</a> and <a href=""http://apps2.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps2.mydomain</a> and was able to get past the ""Server Application Unavailable"" error.  </p>

<p>Now I am getting a 404 error when I tried to browse to the shared site (<a href=""http://apps.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps.mydomain</a>), but I am able to browse to the <a href=""http://apps1.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps1.mydomain</a> and <a href=""http://apps2.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps2.mydomain</a> service reference.</p>

<p><b>Original Problem</b></p>

<p>My companys uses <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742455.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft NLB</a> to load balance traffic between our IIS servers.  I recently deployed a WCF service on to each IIS 6 Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition SP1 servers.  I received the following error when I tried to browse to the shared domain name using IE 7:</p>

<p>The consumer will point to the <a href=""http://apps.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps.mydomain</a> to use the service but virtual domain is mapped to <a href=""http://apps1.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps1.mydomain</a> or <a href=""http://apps2.mydomain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://apps2.mydomain</a>.  If I browse to the service on each server, I do not receive that error.</p>

<p>The service is currently using a anonymous basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this issue?</p>

I think that these tags are great, except for one thing that pisses me off: while the expression language allow you to access bean properties, it does not allow you to call its methods.</p>

<p>In release 1.0, it was not even possible to obtain the length of a string or the number of elements in a collection. As of release 1.1, the fn:length function has been added, so you can do things such as this:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;%@ taglib prefix=""fn"" uri=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions"" %&gt;
...
&lt;c:if test=""${fn:length(str) &gt; 10}""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/c:if&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Which is more verbose and more ugly (IMHO that is) than:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;c:if test=""${str.length() &gt; 10}""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/c:if&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>It seams that JSTL 2.0 will allow you to define new functions, but you will need to write a class specifically for that purpose, in which you will define your (static) methods, and you will also need to write a TLD file that will be included in every jsp that will use these functions.</p>

<p>Whether you define custom function or you use another workaround, you have a lot of additional code to write.</p>

<p>I have read somewhere that the JCP had voluntarily disallow the calling of methods from the expression language.</p>

<p>Can anyone of you help me understand why the hell is the JCP doing this to us?</p>

I tried a quick benchmark and found that, for a <code>struct</code> the difference is quite dramatic (adding two Vectors together a 100 million times took 2.0s with properties and 1.4s with fields). For a reference type, the difference doesn't seem to be that large but it is there.</p>

<p>So why is that? I know that a property is compiled into <code>get_X</code> and <code>set_X</code> methods, which would incur a method call overhead. However, don't these simple getters/setters <em>always</em> get in-lined by the JIT? I know you can't guarantee what the JIT decides to do, but surely this is fairly high on the list of probability? What else is there that separates a public field from a property at the machine level? </p>

<p>And one thing I've been wondering: how is an auto-implemented property (<code>public int Foo { get; set; }</code>) 'better' OO-design than a public field? Or better said: how are those two <em>different</em>? I know that making it a property is easier with reflection, but anything else? I bet the answer to both questions is the same thing.</p>

<p>BTW: I am using .NET 3.5 SP1 which I believe fixed issues where methods with structs (or methods <em>of</em> structs, I'm not sure) weren't in-lined, so that isn't it. I think I am using it at least, it's certainly installed but then again, I'm using Vista 64-bit with SP1 which should have DX10.1 except that I don't have DX10.1 ..</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I appreciate the quick answers guys, but I indicated that I <em>do</em> know that a property access is a method call, but that I don't know why the, presumably, in-lined method is slower than a direct field access. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: So I created another <code>struct</code> that used explicit GetX() methods (o how I don't miss my Java days <em>at all</em>) and that performed the same whether I disabled in-lining on it (through <code>[MethodImplAttribute(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]</code>) or not, so conclusion: non-static methods are apparently never inlined, not even on structs. </p>

<p>I thought that there were exceptions, where the JIT could optmize the virtual method call away. Why can't this happen on structs which know no inheritance and thus a method call can only point to one possible method, right? Or is that because you can implement an interface on it?</p>

<p>This is kind of a shame, since it will really make me think about using properties on performance critical stuff, yet using fields makes me feel dirty and I might as well write what I'm doing in C. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: I found <a href=""http://www.ademiller.com/blogs/tech/2008/08/c-inline-methods-and-optimization/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> posting about the exact same subject. His end conclusion is that the property call did get optimized away. I also could've sworn that I've read plenty of times that simple getter/setter properties will get in-lined, despite being <code>callvirt</code> in the IL. So am I going insane?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong>: Reed Copsey posted the answer in a comment below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re: Edit3 - see my updated comment: I believe this is x86 JIT vs x64 JIT issues. the JIT in x64 is not as mature. I'd expect MS to improve this quickly as more 64 bit systems are coming online every day. – Reed Copsey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my response to his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks, this is the answer! I tried forcing a x86 build and all methods are equally fast, and much faster than the x64. This is very shocking to me actually, I had no idea I was living in the stone age on my 64-bit OS.. I'll include your comment in my answer so it stands out better.  – JulianR</p>

"570056","1","570130","","2009-02-20 15:43:05","","5","7714","<p>this is my very first post! I'm pretty desperate so I'm going above and beyond my standard googling. I believe this is an advanced or expert-level .NET question.</p>

<p>The problem is that I have built a .NET web application that needs to be able to insert user controls dynamically into the middle of a list. I'm quite comfortable with dynamic controls so long they only need to be added to the end of the list (ie: I'm familiar with articles like this: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972976.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972976.aspx</a>). However, if I need to add a UserControl to the front of a Controls collection or somewhere in the middle I'm pretty much lost since the UniqueID of the control is thrown off.</p>

<p>As a simplified example, let's say that i have a Panel to which I am adding a list of UserControls called MyControl.ascx. I also have some event that can get fired on the page to that needs to dynamically insert a MyControl.ascx into the specified index of the Controls collection of the panel. I also have one or more events on MyControl.ascx to which I need to subscribe. This means that the controls need to be loaded BEFORE the events on these controls would fire or else they will not fire. If you don't know to what I'm referring then I either worded the question poorly or this question might be too difficult for you :) </p>

<p>Below is some C# pseudocode to demonstrate the issue. The problem is that the Controls.AddAt(index, control) method does NOT adjust the UniqueID values of the controls accordingly. For example, consider the following controls in a Controls collection:</p>

<p>Whether I'm actually writing code that directly depends on the UniqueID or not, .NET indirectly uses the UniqueID to link together the events that were fired on the previous postback with the controls get loaded on the new postback. Taking my previous example of:</p>

<p>On initial <code>Page Load (Page.IsPostback == false)</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width='100'&gt;Control index&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width='75'&gt;UniqueID&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl01&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl02&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After a postback (<code>Page.IsPostback == false</code>) from some other control that wants to insert the control at index 0:</p>

<p>If i do a <code>Controls.AddAt(0, newControl)</code> then the Controls collection looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width='100'&gt;Control index&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width='75'&gt;UniqueID&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl03&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value0  &lt;== the controls' unique IDs do not shift!&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl01&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl02&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So if i were to click on a linkbutton in the control with Value == value0 and UniqueID == ctl03, the controls would be ordered like the following on post-back and the UniqueIDs would not be in the order i want. This will cause the click event to attach to the wrong control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td width='100'&gt;Control index&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width='75'&gt;UniqueID&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl00&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value0  &lt;== the control i wanted to throw the event&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl01&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl02&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value2&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ctl03&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;value3  &lt;== the actual control to which the event is attached&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If i didn't have to handle events from these dynamic controls this probably wouldn't be a problem. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>// on init i just need to pull the records from the DB, turn them
// into a MyControl.ascx, and then add them to my panel
protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnInit(e);

    // get my List&lt;SomethingFromDB&gt; ordered by value and iterate through, 
    // adding controls to the control collection
    List&lt;SomethingFromDB&gt; myList = remoteService.GetSomeListFromTheDB();
    foreach(SomethingFromDB something in List&lt;SomethingFromDB&gt;)
    {
        // load a new MyControl.ascx
        MyControl myControl = (MyControl )LoadControl(""~/Controls/MyControl .ascx"");
        // populate the values of myControl with the ""something""
        this.populateMyControl(something);
        // dynamically add the control to my panel
        this.myPanel.Add(myControl);     
        // subscribe to event
        myControl.SomeArbitraryEvent += new EventHandler(MyArbitraryHandler);
    }

    // This event gets fired by a magical control on the page and passes a 
    // new SomethingFromDB which needs to be inserted into the DB and then 
    // dynamically inserted into the Controls collection at the specified index
    private void SomeOtherControl_ClickInsert(object sender, MyControlEventArgs e)
    {
        // insert this record into the DB             
        remoteService.InsertIntoDB(e.SomethingFromDB);     
        // dynamically load this control
        MyControl myControl = (MyControl )LoadControl(""~/Controls/MyControl .ascx"");
        // get the index into which we will be inserting this control
        int index = e.NewIndex;                   
        //dynamically add the control to my panel at the specified index.
        // THIS DOES NOT ADJUST THE UNIQUEID VALUES ACCORDINGLY
        // AND IS THE SOURCE OF MY PROBLEM!
        this.myPanel.AddAt(index, myControl);
    }

<p>Thanks for Your answers.
Now I see that i cannot convert from a base class to derived class and i see that it doesn't have anything to do with generics.
But why i cannot create user-defined conversions from a base class? I have a method that returns the base class. I am able to define a conversion method but creating a cast operator imho would be a better solution.</p>

<li><p>Roll Up - Subsites have their own lists (optionally from a list template). Content types are used so the instances can be collected into a Data View Web Part on the parent site.</p></li>

<p>Fri Jan 02 2009 15:27:12 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)</p>

<p>On the server I am using the .NET DateTime format. Should I use something else and do the work on the server? or is there any easy way via JavaScript (ASP.NET AJAX or jQuery) to fix this on the client? </p>

<p>I like just the 'Jan 02 2009 15:27:12' part.  I guess I could use substring(), but am I missing something?</p>

<p><strong>MORE INFO:</strong>
I figured out that the data coming back to the browser was a valid JavaScript Date object.<br>
So you can use any of the native JavaScript Date functions to deal with the value or...
You can use .toString().substring() and trim off what you don't want.</p>

In this case, the value being tested is taken from an element's attribute. The list it is to be tested against comes from the invocation of the stylesheet, and is taken as a top-level <code>&lt;xsl:param&gt;</code> (to be provided on the command-line when I call <code>xsltproc</code> or a Saxon equivalent invocation). For example, the input value may be:</p>

<pre><code>v0_01,v0_10,v0_99
</code></pre>

<p>while the attribute values will each look very much like <em>one</em> such value. (Whether a comma is used to separate values, or a space, is not important-- I chose a comma for now because I plan on passing the value via command-line switch to <code>xsltproc</code>, and using a space would require quoting the argument, and I'm lazy-enough to not want to type the extra two characters.)</p>

<p>What I am looking for is something akin to Perl's <code>grep</code>, wherein I can see if the value I currently have is contained in the list. It can be done with sub-string tests, but this would have to be clever so as not to get a false-positive (<code>v0_01</code> should not match a string that contains <code>v0_011</code>). It seems that the only non-scalar data-type that XSL/XSLT supports is a node-set. I suppose it's possible to convert the list into a set of text nodes, but that seems like over-kill, even compared to making a sub-string test with extra boundaries-checking to prevent false matches.</p>

<p>The application consists of a server WAR and several rich-clients distributed in JARs. The trouble is that it's all in one big, hairy code base, one source tree of > 2k files war. Each JAR has a dedicated class with a <code>main</code> method, but the tangle of dependencies ensnares quickly. It's not all that bad, good practices were followed consistently and there are components with specific tasks. It just needs some improvement to help our team scale as it grows.</p>

<p>The modules will each be in a maven project, built by a parent POM. The process has already started on moving each JAR/WAR into it's own project, but it's obvious that this will only scratch the surface: a few classes in each app JAR and a mammoth ""legacy"" project with everything else. Also, there are already some unit and integration tests.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm interesting in tools, techniques, and general advice to breaking up an overly large and entangled code base into something more manageable. Free/open source is preferred.</p>

<p>Additionally, both AT&amp;T and Intel syntax are available in a <code>prefix</code> and a <code>noprefix</code> version, which differ in whether or not they require to prefix register names with a <code>%</code> sigil.</p>

<p>Depending on which directives are present, the format for address constants changes.</p>

<p>Let's consider the following C code</p>

<pre><code>*(int *)0xdeadbeef = 0x1234;
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>objdump -d</code>, we find that it's compiled to the following assembler instruction</p>

<pre><code>movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef
</code></pre>

<p>As there are no registers involved, this is the correct syntax for both <code>.att_syntax prefix</code> and <code>.att_syntax noprefix</code>, ie. embedded in C code, they look like this</p>

<pre><code>__asm__("".att_syntax prefix"");
__asm__(""movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef"");

__asm__("".att_syntax noprefix"");
__asm__(""movl $0x1234,0xdeadbeef"");
</code></pre>

<p>You can optionally surround the address constant with parentheses, ie.</p>

<pre><code>__asm__(""movl $0x1234,(0xdeadbeef)"");
</code></pre>

<p>will work as well.</p>

<p>When adding a sigil to a plain address constant, the code will fail to copile</p>

<pre><code>__asm__(""movl $0x1234,$0xdeadbeef""); // won't compile
</code></pre>

<p>When surrounding this expression with paranthesis, the compiler will emit wrong code without warning, ie</p>

<pre><code>__asm__(""movl $0x1234,($0xdeadbeef)""); // doesn't warn, but doesn't work!
</code></pre>

<p>This will incorrectly emit the instruction</p>

<pre><code>movl $0x1234,0x0
</code></pre>

<p>In Intel mode, an address constant has to be prefixed with a segment register as well as the operand size and the <code>PTR</code> flag if ambiguity is possible. On my machine (an Intel dual core laptop with Windows XP and current MinGW and Cygwin GCC versions), the register <code>ds</code> is used by default.</p>

<p>Square brackets around the constant are optional. The address constant is also correctly recognized if the segment register is omitted, but the brackets are present. Omitting the register emits a warning on my system, though.</p>

<p>In <code>prefix</code> mode, the segment register has to be prefixed with <code>%</code>, but only using brackets will still work. These are the different ways to generate the correct instruction:</p>

<pre><code>__asm__("".intel_syntax noprefix"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR ds:0xdeadbeef,0x1234"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR ds:[0xdeadbeef],0x1234"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR [0xdeadbeef],0x1234""); // works, but warns!

__asm__("".intel_syntax prefix"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR %ds:0xdeadbeef,0x1234"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR %ds:[0xdeadbeef],0x1234"");
__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR [0xdeadbeef],0x1234""); // works, but warns!
</code></pre>

<p>Omitting both segment register and brackets will fail to compile</p>

<pre><code>__asm__(""mov DWORD PTR 0xdeadbeef,0x1234""); // won't compile
</code></pre>

"630124","1","643747","","2009-03-10 13:21:16","","6","7746","<p>I want to verify that the items in my <code>ListBox</code> are displayed correctly in the UI. I figured one way to do this is to go through all of the children of the <code>ListBox</code> in the visual tree, get their text, and then compare that with what I expect the text to be.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that internally <code>ListBox</code> uses a <code>VirtualizingStackPanel</code> to display its items, so only the items that are visible are created. I eventually came across the <code>ItemContainerGenerator</code> class, which looks like it should force WPF to create the controls in the visual tree for the specified item. Unfortunately, that is causing some weird side affects for me. Here is my code to generate all of the items in the <code>ListBox</code>:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; generatedItems = new List&lt;string&gt;();
IItemContainerGenerator generator = this.ItemsListBox.ItemContainerGenerator;
GeneratorPosition pos = generator.GeneratorPositionFromIndex(-1);
using(generator.StartAt(pos, GeneratorDirection.Forward))
{
    bool isNewlyRealized;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; this.ItemsListBox.Items.Count; i++)
    {
        isNewlyRealized = false;
        DependencyObject cntr = generator.GenerateNext(out isNewlyRealized);
        if(isNewlyRealized)
        {
            generator.PrepareItemContainer(cntr);
        }

        string itemText = GetControlText(cntr);
        generatedItems.Add(itemText);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I can provide the code for <code>GetItemText()</code> if you'd like, but it just traverses the visual tree until a <code>TextBlock</code> is found. I realize that ther are other ways to have text in an item, but I'll fix that up once I get item generation working properly.)</p>

<p>In my app, <code>ItemsListBox</code> contains 20 items, with the first 12 items initially visible. The text for the first 14 items is correct (likely because their controls have already been generated). However, for items 15-20, I don't get any text at all. In addition, if I scroll to the bottom of the <code>ItemsListBox</code>, the text of items 15-20 is also blank. So it seems like I'm interfering with WPF's normal mechanism for generating controls some how.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Is there a different/better way of forcing the items in an <code>ItemsControl</code> to be added to the visual tree?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I think that I have found why this is occurring, although I do not know how to fix it. My assumption that the call to <code>PrepareItemContainer()</code> would generate any necessary controls to display the item, and then add the container to the visual tree in the correct location. It turns out that it is not doing either of these things. The container isn't added to the <code>ItemsControl</code> until I scroll down to view it, and at that time only the container itself (i.e. <code>ListBoxItem</code>) is created - its children are not created (there should be a few controls added here, one of which should be the <code>TextBlock</code> that will display the text of the item).</p>

<p>If I traverse the visual tree of the control that I passed to <code>PrepareItemContainer()</code> the results are the same. In both cases only the <code>ListBoxItem</code> is created, and none of its children are created.</p>

<p>I could not find a good way to add the <code>ListBoxItem</code> to the visual tree. I found the <code>VirtualizingStackPanel</code> in the visual tree, but calling its <code>Children.Add()</code> results in an <code>InvalidOperationException</code> (cannot add items directly to the <code>ItemPanel</code>, since it generates items for its <code>ItemsControl</code>). Just as a test, I tried calling its <code>AddVisualChild()</code> using Reflection (since it is protected), but that didn't work, either.</p>

If the application is distributed, I would not want any of the users to be able to decompile it.

<p>This is why I chose the swich statement as the best answer. It makes the code more complicated but on the other hand I imagine it to be relatively fast and relatively easy to read. (Though I still think there should be a more elegant way ... maybe in the next language I learn :P )</p>

<p>Though if you have some other suggestion I am still waiting (and willing to participate)</p>

For anything wrapped in a IEnumerable, we already have it, as you can .NextFunc() to your heart's content. But for example if you have any fold-like reduction at the end, you can't feed the result of that into a function.</p>

<p>Here are two extension methods, I wondered if anyone else had tried this, and if it's a good idea or not (EDIT: now with <a href=""http://#337846"" rel=""noreferrer"">Earwicker's Maybe</a> included):</p>

<pre><code>public static void Pipe&lt;T&gt;(this T val, Action&lt;T&gt; action) where T : class
{ if (val!=null) action(val); }

public static R Pipe&lt;T, R&gt;(this T val, Func&lt;T, R&gt; func) where T : class where R : class
{ return val!=null?func(val):null; }
</code></pre>

<p>You can then write something like: </p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;string, string[]&gt; readlines = (f) =&gt; File.ReadAllLines(f);
Action&lt;string, string&gt; writefile = (f, s) =&gt; File.WriteAllText(f, s);

Action&lt;string, string&gt; RemoveLinesContaining = (file, text) =&gt;
    {
        file.Pipe(readlines)
            .Filter(s =&gt; !s.Contains(text))
            .Fold((val, sb) =&gt; sb.AppendLine(val), new StringBuilder())
            .Pipe((o) =&gt; o.ToString())
            .Pipe((s) =&gt; writefile(file, s));
    };
</code></pre>

<p>(I know, Filter == Where in C#, and Fold==Aggregate, but I wanted to roll my own, and I could have done WriteAllLines, but that's not the point)</p>

<p>Place the following in a TextMate bundle script, set ""input: entire document"", ""output: insert as text"", ""activation: key equivalent: alt+esc"", ""scope selector: source.python""</p>

<p>I've got a custom user-control embedded in the main Form of my application.  The control contains various subcontrols that manipulate data, which itself is displayed by other controls on the main form.  What I'd like is if the main form could be somehow informed when the user changes subcontrols, so I could update the data and the corresponding display elsewhere.</p>

<p>Right now, I am cheating.  I have a delegate hooked up to the focus-leaving event of the subcontrols.  This delegate changes a property of the user-control I'm not using elsewhere (in this cause, CausesValidation).  I then have a delegate defined on the main form for when the CausesValidation property of the user control changes, which then directs the app to update the data and display.</p>

<p>A problem arises because I also have a delegate set up for when focus leaves the user-control, because I need to validate the fields in the user-control before I can allow the user to do anything else.  However, if the user is just switching between subcontrols, I don't want to validate, because they might not be done editing.</p>

<p>Basically, I want the data to update when the user switches subcontrols OR leaves the user control, but not validate.  When the user leaves the control, I want to update AND validate.  Right now, leaving the user-control causes validation to fire twice.</p>

I would like to compile my application as:</p>

<p>MyAppDebug - in debug mode
and just
MyApp - in release mode</p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is possible?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>It seems some people are questioning the reasoning behind the question, so I'll explain a little further:</p>

<p>I'm working on a Silverlight application which gets automatically uploaded to our test site when I to a ""build solution"". The trouble is, the test team are now testing the online version, whilst I work on a new one. So, I want to have a url like .\MyApp.html for the regular version that the QA team will test and then .\MyApp.html?version=debug for the current version that I'm working on.</p>

I have a large image background, say 480×6000 pixels, of only a part is visible (exactly one screen’s worth, 480×320 pixels). What is the best way to get such a background on the screen?</p>

<p>Currently I have the background split into several textures (to get around the maximum texture size limit) and draw the whole background in each frame as a textured triangle strip. The scrolling is done by translating the modelview matrix. The scissor box is set to the window size, 480×320 pixels. This is not meant to be fast, I just wanted a working code before I get to optimizing.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe the OpenGL implementation would be smart enough to discard the invisible portion of the background, but according to some measuring code I wrote it looks like background takes 7 ms to draw on average and 84 ms at maximum. (This is measured in the simulator.) This is about a half of the whole render loop, ie. quite slow for me. </p>

<p>Drawing the background should be as easy as copying some 480×320 pixels from one part of the VRAM to another, or, in other words, blazing fast. What is the best way to get closer to such performance?</p>

If I have actions that I know a user will not be able to perform due to insufficient privileges or object state, should the UI elements for those actions be hidden from the user, visible but disabled, or visible and result in an error if attempted? What would be the rationale for your answer? If disabled, would you communicate the reason why and, if so, how?</p>

<p>This is a web interface so I already know that I need to check the incoming post/get for permissions and handle errors there anyway.  I'm primarily talking about how to handle the UI.</p>

<p>This is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79033/rules-about-disabling-or-hiding-menu-items"">Rules about disabling or hiding menu items</a>, though I am interested in all types of UI elements not just menus.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a New page that allows a user to create a new Event.  Events can be master events or subevents.  Creating a master event requires ""EditMasterEvent"" privilege, while creating a subevent requires only ""EditEvent"" privilege.  I have a drop down that allows one to choose an existing event as the parent (master event) or no parent (this is a master event).  Should the ""Create Master Event"" choice be shown on the dropdown or omitted if the user only has ""EditEvent"" privileges.</p></li>
<li><p>Deleting events requires that you be an application administrator or have the appropriate edit permission for the event type.  In the latter case, the event must also be more than 5 years old.  Deleting an event causes major cascading deletes of related data in the system and for legal reasons this data must be kept for at least 5 years after the event.  Since this operation is rare for the normal user, the typical case is that the action is not available.  Should it be shown always or only when actually possible?</p></li>

<p>The process runs fine on my development and staging servers, but of course the client is cheap and is only paying for shared hosting, which isn't as fast as my dev/staging boxes. As a result, PDF generation threads are timing out.</p>

<p>The flow is something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Page is run to generate PDFs.</li>
<li>A query is run to determine which PDFs need to be generated, and a loop fires off an application-scoped UDF call for each PDF that will need to be generated.</li>
<li>That UDF looks up information for the given item, and then creates a thread for the PDF generation to work in, preventing generation from slowing down the page.</li>
<li>The thread simply uses CFDocument to create a PDF and save it to disk, then terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Threads do not re-join, and nothing is waiting for any of them to finish. The page that makes the UDF calls finishes in a few milliseconds; it's the threads themselves that are timing out.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the UDF (and thread creation):</p>

I also got a little excited when I saw that <a href=""http://cfquickdocs.com/cf8/?getDoc=cfthread#cfthread"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the CFThread tag has a timeout parameter</a>, but then realized it only applies when joining threads (action=join).</p>

<p>Changing the default timeout in ColdFusion Administrator is not an option, as this is a shared host.</p>

Since I am new to the project, I am currently submitting any changes I make as patches, to make it easier for the other team members to review my changes and decide whether or not to commit them to the trunk. However, when I create a patch using the Create Patch option in the Team menu, the resulting patch contains absolute paths to the files that have changed. Since I want to be able to e-mail these patches to other team members and have them simply apply the patches to their own working folder, I would like to produce patches that contain only relative file paths (I'm running on Ubuntu and currently my working copy is in my home folder, so the absolute paths are especially annoying).</p>

<p>Is there a way to configure Eclipse/Subclipse to do this? I searched the Eclipse Preferences and clicked through the Create Patch wizard a few times, but I couldn't find anything that looks like it will do this. Currently, I'm manually editing the patch files with a text editor to convert the absolute file paths to relative paths. If Subclipse can't do this, I'm open to other suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I know that there is the option to ignore a certain number of segments in file name paths when you go to apply the patch from within Eclipse, but I was curious if there was a way to avoid this to reduce the number of steps involved in applying patches. By manually editing the paths to make them relative to the project's root folder, an end-user just has to be sure to apply the patch at the root project folder level. I'd like to have that simplicity without having to manually edit the patch files.</p>

We suspect it is something configured on the file server that is causing this behaviour, but are not sure what ... can you help?</p>

<p>After the file copy operation, the file server (Windows 2K3 R2) reports that the source file is being held with a read lock, even though no further operation is done with the file on the server. The lock is released once the application quits.</p>

<p>We are able to reproduce the behaviour, even with the most basic code seen below :</p>

<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string sourceFile = @""\\win2K3server\resource\Production\IQE\sourceFolder\iqeconsole.exe"";
    string destinationFile = @""d:\destinationFolder\iqeconsole.exe"";
    System.IO.File.Copy(sourceFile,destinationFile,true);

    Console.ReadLine();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The lock occurrs immediately during the <code>File.Copy()</code> line executing, and persists after this line has finished. In a more complex application, when the routine with the <code>File.Copy()</code> exits(but the application is still running), the lock persists.</p>

<p>Only when the entire application is finished is the lock released.</p>

<p>Changing <code>sourceFile</code> to use a mapped drive instead of a UNC path makes no difference to the behaviour.</p>

<p>This behaviour does not happen when the source file is located on another server, or is located locally.</p>

<p>If we add the following line after the <code>File.Copy</code>, the lock is released immediately :</p>

<pre><code>new System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission(System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermissionAccess.Read, new string[] { sourceFile }).Demand();
</code></pre>

<p>This all sounds to us as though there is something on the server that is causing this behaviour. We have ShadowProtect installed on the server along with McAfee anti-virus. Apart from that, it appears as though there is nothing else installed over-and-above Windows Server and its components.</p>

<p>We are also not sure why Demanding a read permission on the file solves the problem.</p>

<p>If you could answer these questions, we would appreciate it greatly:</p>

"594442","1","594622","","2009-02-27 11:47:51","","18","7792","<p>I recently read the questions that recommend against using switch-case statements in languages that do support it. As far as Python goes, I've seen a number of switch case replacements, such as:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Using a dictionary (Many variants)  </li>
<li>Using a Tuple  </li>
<li>Using a function decorator (<a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/</a>)  </li>
<li>Using Polymorphism (Recommended method instead of type checking objects)  </li>
<li>Using an if-elif-else ladder  </li>
<li>Someone even recommended the Visitor pattern (Possibly Extrinsic)  </li>
</ol>

<p>Given the wide variety of options, I am having a bit of difficulty deciding what to do for a particular piece of code. I would like to learn the criteria for selecting one of these methods over the other in general. In addition, I would appreciate advice on what to do in the specific cases where I am having trouble deciding (with an explanation of the choice).</p>

<p>Here is the specific problem:<br>
(1)  </p>

<pre><code>def _setCurrentCurve(self, curve):
        if curve == ""sine"":
            self.currentCurve =  SineCurve(startAngle = 0, endAngle = 14,
            lineColor = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), expansionFactor = 1,
            centerPos = (0.0, 0.0))
        elif curve == ""quadratic"":
            self.currentCurve = QuadraticCurve(lineColor = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
</code></pre>

<p>This method is called by a <strong>qt-slot</strong> in response to choosing to draw a curve from a menu. The above method will contain a total of 4-7 curves once the application is complete. Is it justified to use a throw away dictionary in this case? Since the most obvious way to do this is if-elif-else, should I stick with that? I have also consider using **kargs here (with a friends help) since all the curve classes use **kargs...</p>

<p>(2)<br>
This second piece of code is a <strong>qt-slot</strong> that is called when the user changes a property of a curve. Basically the slot takes the data from the gui (spinBox) and puts it in an instance variable of the appropriate curve class. In this case, I again have the same question - should I use a dict?</p>

<p>Here is the aforementioned slot- </p>

<pre><code>def propertyChanged(self, name, value):
    """"""A Qt slot, to react to changes of SineCurve's properties.""""""
    if name == ""amplitude"":
        self.amplitude = value
    elif name == ""expansionFactor"":
        self.expansionFactor = value
    elif name == ""startAngle"":
        self.startAngle = value
    elif name == ""endAngle"":
        self.endAngle = value  
</code></pre>

<p>For reference, here is the code for connecting to the above slot -  </p>

<pre><code>def _connectToPage(self, page):
    for connectionData in page.getConnectibles():
        self.connect(connectionData[""object""],
                    SIGNAL(connectionData[""signal""]),
                    lambda value, name = connectionData[""property""]:\
                        self.currentCurve.propertyChanged(name, value))
        self.connect(connectionData[""object""],
                    SIGNAL(connectionData[""signal""]),
                    self.hackedDisplayArea.update) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - The self.endAngle etc. are initialized in the constructor.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the reasons for choosing a dict is for fast lookup. When is that warranted? when I have 100 cases or more? Is it a good idea to keep building and throwing away a dictionary each time the function is called? If I build a dict for this purpose outside a function, should I check If it is needed elswhere? What happens if it is not needed elsewhere?</p>

<p>My question is what is the best-practice if there is one? What is the best/most elegant way to go about things? Put in yet another way, when to use <strong>if-elif-else</strong>, when to use each of the other options?</p>

<p>Now as far as my eye can see, and KDiff3 for that matter, my files are pretty much identical to the files that would be output if I were to open Excel and put the comments into the cells by hand in Excel.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good example of attaching a comment to a cell with OpenXml?  Is there something I should know about maybe a relationship?  Does it have something to do with using an Excel file that I created and then I'm using as a template (maybe some dimensions aren't set)?</p>

<p>In the mousePressed method I've played around with getting all the selected rows from the table, and was then going to check if the newly clicked row was in the selectedRows... However, I'm not sure if there is a way to see which row is associated with the MouseEvent. </p>

<p>(Also, I know expected behaviour such as this shouldn't be played around with too much, but it's to replicate a legacy system in the company)</p>

"667588","1","667738","","2009-03-20 19:22:20","","2","7796","<p>I have a Windows service written in Delphi.  One of the third-party resources it uses occasionally gets corrupted, and the only way I've found to fix the situation is to exit and restart the program.  I can detect when the resource is corrupted from within the program, and I can tell Windows to restart the service after it stops, but I can't figure out how to have the service tell itself to stop.</p>

<p>The program is pretty simple.  I created a service application in what seems to be the normal way.  I have a subclass of TService to manage the service, while all of the functionality occurs in a separate thread.  The TService subclass pretty much just manages the execution of the subthread, and it's in the subthread that I would be detecting the corruption.</p>

<p>For reference, here's the header info for the service and subthread.</p>

<pre><code>type
  TScannerThread = class(TThread)
   private     
    Scanner    : TScanner;
    DefaultDir : String;
    ImageDir   : String;
    procedure CheckScanner;
   public      
    Parent     : TComponent;
    procedure Execute; override;
  end;

    function GetServiceController: TServiceController; override;
  end;            

var
  CardScanSvc : TCardScanSvc;
</code></pre>

<p>In a GUI application, I'd call Application.Terminate, but TServiceApplication doesn't seem to have that method.  I can terminate the subthread, but the main thread never notices, and Windows thinks the service is still running.  I can't really think of much else to try.</p>

<p>The program was originally created in Delphi 5, and I'm currently using Delphi 2007, in case that makes a difference.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>With mghie's code, I can stop the service, but Windows will only restart the service if it fails unexpectedly, not if it's stopped normally.  What I'm going to do is make a separate service application, have the first signal the second if it has problems, and then have the second restart the first.</p>

But there doesn't appear to be a corresponding function for interrogating a symbolic link to obtain the path of the link's target.</p>

<p>I have found out that symbolic links are an implementation of reparse points, and so the reparse point functions can be used to obtain the target path. But the header files that I need to use reparse points appear to come with the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/wdk/default.mspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Windows Driver Kit</a>. Setting up this kit with VS2008 appears to be a non trivial task.</p>

<p>Is there a nice simple function that I've missed for obtaining a link's target, or do I really have to set up a windows driver development environment just to write code to access this information?</p>

<p>EDIT: Adam Mitz came up with the suggestion of GetFinalPathNameByHandle. This function works just great for local symlinks, but doesn't appear to work for resolving remote links (via a UNC path).</p>

<p>EDIT 2: At Adam's request, here are more details of what I've tried:</p>

<p>I initially went down the <code>FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT</code>/ <code>DeviceIoControl</code> route, but that yields a <code>REPARSE_DATA_BUFFER</code> structure. The headers that define this structure seem to exist solely within the Windows Driver Kit.</p>

<p><code>GetFinalPathNameByHandle()</code> works fine when the link exists on a local disk (<code>C:\...\link</code> etc). Curiously, I found that I could obtain the handle to the link - and thus get the target - using <code>CreateFileW()</code> whether the <code>FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</code> flag was specified or not, regardless of whether the target file exists.</p>

<p>When <code>CreateFileW()</code> and <code>GetFinalPathNameByHandle()</code> are used to interrogate a remote link though (<code>\\?\UNC\....</code>), things start to unravel. If <code>FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</code> is specified, <code>GetFinalPathNameByHandle()</code> always returns the link path, not the target path. If <code>FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT</code> is not specified, then the target path is returned, but only if the target exists and is on the same machine as the link. If the link points to another machine, I get a network permissions error. If the link points to a local - non-existent - file, I get a file not found error.</p>

<pre><code>ant &lt;environment task&gt; dist
</code></pre>

<p>Than it is to type:</p>

<pre><code>ant -propertyfile &lt;environment property file&gt; dist
</code></pre>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;project name=""whatever"" default=""dist""&gt;

&lt;target name=""local""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""webXml"" value=""WebContent/WEB-INF/web-local.xml""/&gt;

<p>I am finding it hard to convince them that properties files are they right way to go.  I believe properties files are better because:</p>

<ul>
<li>They provides more flexibility - if you need a new environment just add a new properties file</li>
<li>It's clearer what's going on - You have to know about this little ""trick"" to realize what they're accomplishing</li>
<li>Doesn't provide default values and the ability to use overrides - if they used property files they could provide defaults at the top of the project but have the ability to override them with a file</li>
<li>Script won't break if an environment task isn't supplied on command line</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course all they hear is that they need to change their Ant script and have to type more on the command line.</p>

<p>Can you provide any additional arguments in favor of properties files over ""property tasks""?</p>

<p>I learned the concept of the memcache queue from <a href=""http://broddlit.wordpress.com/2008/04/09/memcached-as-simple-message-queue/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog post</a>:</p>

<p><em>All messages are saved with an integer as key. There is one key that has the next key and one that has the key of the oldest message in the queue. To access these the increment/decrement method is used as its atomic, so there are two keys that act as locks. They get incremented, and if the return value is 1 the process has the lock, otherwise it keeps incrementing. Once the process is finished it sets the value back to 0. Simple but effective. One caveat is that the integer will overflow, so there is some logic in place that sets the used keys to 1 once we are close to that limit. As the increment operation is atomic, the lock is only needed if two or more memcaches are used (for redundancy), to keep those in sync.</em></p>

<p>My question is, is there a memcache-based message queue service that can run on App Engine?</p>

<p>Basically I've been considering the implications of using Fluent-NHibernate to replace a dated TypedDataSet model with a domain driven design that can return simple objects from the DAL. If Fluent-NHibernate cannot work with SPs easily, I think I would most likley have a combinational DAL that will take advantage of FNH for simple CRUD operations while leaving complex procedures to be managed by Enterprise Library.

Our goal is to reliably produce a minidump on any unhandled exception, whether the exception is managed or unmanaged, and whether it occurs on a managed or unmanaged thread.</p>

<p>We use the excellent <a href=""http://www.debuginfo.com/tools/clrdump.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ClrDump</a> library for this currently, but it does not quite provide the exact features we need, and I'd like to understand the mechanisms behind exception filtering, so I set out to try this for myself.</p>

<p>I started out by following this blog article to install an SEH handler myself:  <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2007/12.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2007/12.aspx</a>.  This technique works for console applications, but when I try the same thing from a WinForms application, my filter is not called for any variety of unmanaged exceptions.</p>

<p>What can ClrDump be doing that I'm not doing?  ClrDump produces dumps in all cases, so its  exception filter must still be called...</p>

<p>Note:  I'm aware of ADPlus's capabilities, and we've also considered using the AeDebug registry keys...  These are also possibilities, but also have their tradeoffs.</p>

<p>I have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web applications.</p>

Solution

+-CommonControlsWebApp
| +- resources
| |  +- images
| |  +- scripts
| |  +- stylesheets
| +- UserControls
| 
+-WebApp1
| 
+-WebApp2
| 
+-WebApp3
</pre>

<p>This is what I know this far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can not compile CommonControlsWebApp into a single dll since I am creating user controls. This is only possible with custom server controls, where everything is in the code-behind file. So I need a way to share the ascx files between the four projects.
<li>Copying the files from CommonControlsWebApp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution explorer. I would have to 'add exting items' all in all three WebApps when a file is added or renamed in CommonControls.
<li>Changing to the Web Site model would remedy this, but I am worried about the compile time for WebApp1-3 if I do this.
<li>'Add as link' does not work for directories.
<li>I could use Subversion to share the files between the projects, but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if I am developing a user control that I have to test through one of the WebApps.
</ul>

<p><strong>Can it really be true that ASP.NET does not have a good solution for this? How are you guys organizing large web applications?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Thanks a lot for all the answers. I am going to copy my user controls with a build event for now, and then see if we have time to refactor them into server controls.</p>

<p>The solution I've found so far is to symlink each required jar to <code>&lt;webdir&gt;/WEB-INF/lib/</code>.</p>

<p>This is not so good, because I have to symlink a lot of jars and even worse to symlink all jars my direct dependency lib (jar) requires (and so on). In case my direct dependency lib changes its list of required jars I'll have to maintain that symlinks.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve to translate that snippet into a single text box and a checkbox control. Of course, had the snippet contained more nodes more controls would be generated automatically.</p>

<p>Give the iterative nature of the task, I have chosen to use Repeater. Within it I have placed two (well more, see bellow) Controls, one CheckBox and one Editbox. In order to choose which control get activate, I used an inline switch command, checking the name of the current configuration node.</p>

<p>Sadly, that doesn't work. The problem lies in the fact that the switch is being run during rendering time, long after data binding had happened. That alone would not be a problem, was not for the fact that a configuration node might offer the needed info to data bind. Consider what would happen if the check box control will try to bind to the text node in the snippet above, desperately looking for it's ""checked"" attribute.</p>

<p>Here are details:</p>

<p>I did a merge branch to trunk of <em>project</em> which I am working on. </p>

<p><em>Project</em> includes main repository and libraries joint to main repository as <em>svn external</em> (libraries are also branched) as subdirectory of <em>project</em>.</p>

<p>When I was trying to commit changes TortoiseSVN said:</p>

<pre><code>Commit A
re all the targets part of the same working copy? 
Unable to lock 'D:\websites\project\lib' 
Please execute the ""Cleanup"" command.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course <em>Cleanup</em> didn't help.</p>

<p><em>svn:external</em> keyword for <em>project</em> directory was well defined, also <em>lib</em> folder still contained proper version of libraries (trunk version).</p>

<p>Both SVN server and client are in 1.5.x version (TortoiseSVN is 1.5.3.x).</p>

<p>From technical point of view both <em>project</em> and <em>libraries</em> are projects in the same SVN repository.</p>

<p>Any idea what went wrong?</p>

<p>I had been googling a bit for the solution, but didn't find anything useful, so I tried to commit my changes in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>commit changes from project folder</li>
<li>commit changes from libraries folder</li>
</ol>

<p>Which went without any problems.</p>

<p>But I am still wondering why I couldn't commit everything in one commit.</p>

<li>Disabled vertical scrollbar on listbox. </li>
<li>Removed height on coverImage</li>
<li>Changed from layoutTransformation to RenderTransformation</li>
<li>Shrink non-selected item instead of scaling selected item.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives me nearly what I want. There is a gap between the coverImage and the coverReflection that I cant find a reason for. Any clues for that, og maybe I should post a new  question...?</p>

<p><strong>Second Update:</strong><br>
I think I have a solution for the reflection-gap to now. It feels a little awkward, though. I guess there are better ways of doing it.</p>

<p>What I've done is 
 - I'm no longer flipping the border, I'm flipping the visual brush instead. 
 - I have added a TileMode=""Tile"" for the visual brush</p>

<p>Now, I'm not sure why this works, but it's coming close to what I want, so...</p>

The setup is your standard ""load snapshot immediately"" kind of thing where the first thing it does after initializing the subscription is to drop and recreate all tables on the subscriber side and then start doing a BCP of all the data.  The problem is that there are a few tables with several million rows in them, and the process either a) takes a <em>REALLY</em> long time or b) just flat out fails.  The messages I keep getting when I look in Replication Monitor are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The process is running and is waiting for a response from the server.</li>
<li>Query timeout expired</li>
<li>Initializing</li>
</ul>

<p>It then tries to restart the bulk loading process (skipping any BCP files that it has already loaded).</p>

<p>I am currently stuck where it just keeps doing this over and over again.  It's been running for a couple days now.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there something I could do to improve this situation given that the network connection is so slow? Maybe some setting or something?  I don't mind waiting a long time as long as the process doesn't keep timing out.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better way to do this? Perhaps make a backup, zip it, copy it over and then restore?  If so, how would the replication process know where to pick up when it starts applying the transactions, since updates will be occurring between the time I make the backup and get it restored and running on the other side.</p></li>

<p>But, while the <code>printf</code> specification defines <code>%C</code> as an equivalent for <code>%lc</code> and <code>%S</code> as an equivalent for <code>%ls</code>, only <code>%C</code> and <code>%S</code> appear to work correctly with <code>NSLog</code> and <code>+[NSString stringWithFormat:]</code>.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    unichar str[3];

    NSLog(@""%%C:  %C"", str[0]);

    [pool drain];

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: skipping non-radio button in group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that in MFC you put radio buttons in groups to indicate which sets of radio buttons go together.  If I remember correctly you do this by setting the ""group"" property of the first radio button to true, and then set the rest of the radio buttons ""group"" property to false.</p>

<p>I have three questions about this warning.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do you get rid of this warning? Do 
you have to set the ""group"" property of all
non-radio button controls to true to
avoid this, or should you just set
it for the first control after the
last radio button?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an easy way to figure
out what controls or dialogs have this problem?
I could open each dialog and
fiddle with it until the warning
pops up.  This application has a lot of
dialogs though, so it would be
nice if there was an easier way.</p></li>
<li><p>What negative behavior can occur if 
you don't fix this warning? In other

My goal is to modify the program so that it uses my USB flash drive. Now I see how the INT 13H function has been used with the floppy device, but I guess my question is, how will communicating with the USB drive differ?</p>

<p>For example, here is a snippet of the floppy code (GNU assembler):
<pre><code></p>

<pre><code>    movb    $0x00,%dl       /* select 1st floppy */

    /* later */

    movw    sec,%cx     /* get sector number */
    movw    head,%dx    /* get head number */

    movw    $0x0201,%ax /* read 1 sector */
    int $0x13

<p>Now I have read that moving 0x80 into %dl will select the first HDD in the BIOS. In my particular bios I can change the drive order, which would include a USB drive. I am quite sure this is becoming BIOS dependant, but I was thinking that the order listed in the BIOS could correspond to the value I move into %dl. I need to track down some documentation...</p>

<p>I am really unfamiliar with working with block devices as it is, can someone point me to a good place to start learning more?</p>

However, there is usually a significant lag between the action and the actual playing of the sound.  I have tried both embedding the sound in the .swf, and loading it externally at the start, but both lead to the same results.  Likewise, I've tried with compressed and uncompressed audio.</p>

<p>What it <em>seems</em> like is that the audio buffers are just a lot longer than I need them to be, like perhaps Flash is optimized more towards playing longer sounds without any stutter at the expense of a little more latency in starting sounds.  Could this be it?  Is there any way to change them?  Since what I'm working on will never need to play sounds more than a second or so long and will always be loaded completely at the start, it wouldn't hurt it at all to have really short buffers.</p>

<p>One other possible thing that might be the cause: if I use .wav files when using loadSound()... I can't get it to actually play the sounds.  There's no errors, and everything returns as it should, but no actual sound is played, which is why I have them as .mp3 currently.  Perhaps when using .mp3 audio (or any compressed audio), there just will be lag in decoding it?  The reason I still have doubts about this, though, is that when embedding them in the .swf as .wav files (by importing them into the library), they still have the same latency on playback.</p>

<p>Just for a sanity check, I'll include the code I've got, minus irrelevant parts and error checking.  First, loading them at runtime:</p>

loadSound( ""click"", ""sounds/buttondroop4.mp3"" );

<p>And an alternate way, embedding them in the library as classes and going from there:</p>

<pre><code>var sClick:soundClick = new soundClick();
var sHover:soundHover = new soundHover();
sClick.play();
sHover.play();
</code></pre>

<p>The sound files are tiny, less than 10kb generally.  The lag is apparent enough that one of the first complaints someone had when looking at it was that the sound effects on button hovers seemed delayed, so it wasn't just me being picky.  I feel like I must just be doing something wrong; there's too many flash things out there that have snappy sound effects without anywhere near this kind of lag.</p>

<p>edit: In response to the first response about sound files themselves, I've already checked, and the sound starts immediately at the start of the file (even clipping out everything but the very first millisecond of sound, I can still hear the start of the 'tick' noise it makes).</p>

I am in the unenviable position of modifying a legacy VB6 app with some enhancements.  Converting to a smarter language isn't an option.
The app relies on a large collection of user defined types to move data around.  I would like to define a common function that can take a reference to any of these types and extract the data contained.<br>
In pseudo code, here's what I'm looking for:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub PrintUDT ( vData As Variant )
  for each vDataMember in vData
    print vDataMember.Name &amp; "": "" &amp; vDataMember.value

<pre><code>    public LogFolderTraceListener(string logFilePath)
    {
        this.logFilePath = logFilePath;

</code></pre>

<pre><code>System.InvalidOperationException : The type 'AlwaysClosedTextFileTraceListener' specified for custom trace listener named 'MyLogFile' does not a default constructor, which is required when no InitData is specified in the configuration.
</code></pre>

<p>From here on in, my investigations have very much come to, the opposite of dead ends, infinite probability problems.</p>

<li>There is another class <code>SystemDiagnosticsTraceListenerNode : TraceListenerNode</code> which seems to make the <code>Data</code> class presentable to the configuration application</li>

I need all the column values from each tr below the tr with the date up until the next tr with valign=""bottom"" (next date). The number of tr with column data is unknown, can be zero or a lot of them.</p>

<p>But I get following error “<strong>The same table 'contact' cannot be the child table in two nested relations.</strong>”</p>

<p>The XSD compiles correctly but it’s the typed dataset that can’t handle repeating tables. Now I have tested also the xsd.exe tool but it seems to generate the same code as the msdatasetgenerator. I also tried some third party code generator tools like XSD2Code, CodeXS, AltovaXmlSpy but also I can’t get it to work with nested elements.</p>

<p>Alternatively I could solve the problem with xslt transformation at the input and the output but it would cost me a lot of performance. </p>

<p>So now I’m asking if someone could help me with a good solution for VS2005, or know good xsd class generator that can handle this problem. It doesn’t have to be a typed dataset if it works as an array or a list it is also perfect as long it is easy to serializing and deserializing it.</p>

<pre><code>Int 1: 14
Int 2: 4
Int 3: 8
Int 4: 4

Hash Sum: 43
</code></pre>

<p>I have some restriction in the values, the maximum value that and attribute can have is 30, the addition of all of them is always 30. And the attributes are always positive.</p>

<p>The key is that I want to generate the same hash sum for similar integers, for example if I have the integers, 14, 4, 10, 2 then I want to generate the same hash sum, in the case above 43. But of course if the integers are very different (4, 4, 2, 20) then I should have a different hash sum. Also it needs to be fast. </p>

<p>Ideally I would like that the output of the hash sum is between 0 and 512, and it should evenly distributed. With my restrictions I can have around 5K different possibilities, so what I would like to have is around 10 per bucket.</p>

<p>I am sure there are many algorithms that do this, but I could not find a way of googling this thing. Can anyone please post an algorithm to do this?.</p>

<p><strong>Some more information</strong></p>

<p>The whole thing with this is that those integers are attributes for a function. I want to store the values of the function in a table, but I do not have enough memory to store all the different options. That is why I want to generalize between similar attributes.</p>

<p>The reason why 10, 5, 15 are totally different from 5, 10, 15, it is because if you imagine this in 3d then both points are a totally different point</p>

<p><strong>Some more information 2</strong></p>

<p>Some answers try to solve the problem using hashing. But I do not think this is so complex. Thanks to one of the comments I have realized that this is a clustering algorithm problem. If we have only 3 attributes and we imagine the problem in 3d, what I just need is divide the space in blocks.</p>

<p>In fact this can be solved with rules of this type</p>

<pre><code>if (att[0] &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; att[1] &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; att[2] &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; att[3] &lt; 5)

I know that it works (most of the time, anyways) because my company's webapp does it often, but I don't know if it's actually supported in the standard or if I can rely on this behavior.  I'm considering implementing a SOAP request handler that uses a parameter after the question mark to indicate that it is a SOAP request and not a normal HTTP request.  The reason for this that the webapp is an IIS extension, so everything is accessed via the same URL (ex: example.com/myisapi.dll?command), so to get the SOAP request to be processed, I need to specify that ""command"" parameter.  There would be one generic command for SOAP, not a specific command for each SOAP action -- those would be specified in the SOAP request itself.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to integrate the Apache Axis2/C library into my webapp by letting the webapp handle the HTTP request and then pass off the incoming SOAP XML to Axis2 for handling if it's a SOAP request.  Intuitively, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't work, since the URL you're posting to is just an arbitrary URL, as far as all the various components are concerned... it's the server that gives special meaning to the parts after the question mark.</p>

<p>This seems to work for primitives, int?, char? double? and bool?. So that might work for those but what about strings? Am I missing something here. What types should I be using for primitive values and for string values so that I do not have to repeatedly test values before inserting them.</p>

Before I get too many answers about ternary operators. I like them but not in this context.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Okay, so guys help me formulate my plan of attack. I will use the Nullable for my primitives (int?, double? etc) and for my Strings I will use the String but the ?? test. This keeps things less verbose. Is there anything that I am missing here, like maybe losing some semantics?</p>

<p>I was looking for a way to separate clearly some softwares internals from their representation in c++</p>

<p>I have a generic parameter class (to be later stored in a container) that can contain any kind of value with the the boost::any class</p>

<p>I have a base class (roughly) of this kind (of course there is more stuff)</p>

<pre><code>class Parameter

private:

}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two levels of derived classes:
The first level defines the type and the conversion to/from string (for example ParameterInt or ParameterString)
The second level defines the behaviour and the real creators (for example deriving ParameterAnyInt and ParameterLimitedInt from ParameterInt or ParameterFilename from GenericString)</p>

<p>Depending on the real type I would like to add external function or classes that operates depending on the specific parameter type without adding virtual methods to the base class and without doing strange casts</p>

<p>For example I would like to create the proper gui controls depending on parameter types:</p>

<pre><code>Widget* CreateWidget(const Parameter&amp; p)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I cannot understand real Parameter type from this unless I use RTTI or implement it my self (with enum and switch case), but this is not the right OOP design solution, you know.</p>

<p>The classical solution is the Visitor design pattern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern</a></p>

<p>The problem with this pattern is that I have to know in advance which derived types will be implemented, so (putting together what is written in wikipedia and my code) we'll have sort of: </p>

<pre><code>struct Visitor 
{
  virtual void visit(ParameterLimitedInt&amp; wheel) = 0;
  virtual void visit(ParameterAnyInt&amp; engine) = 0;
  virtual void visit(ParameterFilename&amp; body) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any solution to obtain this behaviour in any other way without need to know in advance all the concrete types and without deriving the original visitor?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/31913"">Dr. Pizza's solution seems the closest to what I was thinking</a>, but the problem is still the same and the method is actually relying on dynamic_cast, that I was trying to avoid as a kind of (even if weak) RTTI method</p>

<p>Maybe it is better to think to some solution without even citing the visitor Pattern and clean our mind. The purpose is just having the function such:</p>

I remembered InfoPath saved its data as XML, and took another look at it.  It's great the way it allows you to define a form based on an XSD (XML Schema), and then allow the user to edit XML without knowing it is an XML file.  The resulting XML validates perfectly due to InfoPath's input constraints.</p>

<p>The one problem is that we cannot assume our user base will have MS InfoPath installed.</p>

<p>So I decided to use an xml file to store the data, because a dbms would take too long to load and code to handle a plain text file would be hard to maintain.</p>

<p>The data is mainly composed of Links that stores two file paths, one for the origin and one for the destination, one boolean that represent the state of the link before the program is closed, and a few other less important things.</p>

<p>When the program loads the data should be read restoring the previous state of the application.</p>

<p>So I made a xml file like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
  &lt;Directories&gt;
    &lt;Directory id=""0""&gt;
      &lt;FilePath&gt;C:\Test1&lt;/FilePath&gt;
      &lt;PathSeparator&gt;\&lt;/PathSeparator&gt;
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>And used a DataSet to get the data.</p>

<pre><code>Directory getDirectory()
{
    ds = new DataSet();
                ds.ReadXml(xmlPath);
    DataRow[] myRow = ds.Tables[""Directory""].
                Select(""id =""+id.ToString());// ""id = id""
    string temp = myRow[0][""FilePath""].ToString();
    Directory result = new Directory();
    result.path = temp;
    temp = myRow[0][""PathSeparator""].ToString();
    result.pathSeparator = temp[0];
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>All that works just fine, but then I tried to add new ""rows"" to the xml:</p>

<pre><code>public static int addDirectory(DataSet ds, char pathSeparator, string path)
{
    DataRow myRow = ds.Tables[""Directory""].NewRow();
    myRow.ItemArray[0] = 8;
    myRow.ItemArray[1] = path;
    myRow.ItemArray[2] = pathSeparator.ToString();
    myRow.ItemArray[3] = ""lol"";
    ds.Tables[""Directory""].Rows.Add(myRow);
    ds.AcceptChanges();
    ds.WriteXml(ApplicationDataManager.xmlPath);
    return 8;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But all this writes is  to a random place on the .xml</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>By the way if anyone have any suggestions about how I should store that data, I would be glad to hear(read).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>[Update]
File Links are used to create a connection between two directories, so they can be synchronized.</p>

<p>When I first started using MVC I quite often had the controller doing manipulation on the models after database work had been done.  I knew this was bad so moved that work into the models.  However I'm not happy with that as I want my models to be very learn.</p>

<p>I've done a bit of reading and I see that people are keeping their controllers and models lean by having a service layer, which I like the look of.  </p>

<p>I'm just trying to understand how a service layer and repository should all work together.  Here are my assumptions, can you please let me know if this is a good way of working?</p>

<ol>
<li>The controller can call the repository directly if no manipulation needs to be done on the data and as such a service layer does not need to get involved</li>
<li>Once any work needs to be done to data (business logic) then this should be done in the service layer and the controller will make a simple call to the service layer as and when required</li>
<li>Once a service has done it's business logic it will then use the repository as necessary (if data needs to be persisted).</li>
<li>Models ideally should be kept lean, ideally actings as nothing more than DTOs</li>
<li>Validation of data will be done within the models (using MonoRail validation attributes).  I appreciate not even one likes polluting their models with lots of attributes, but that is a different discussion.  I like the benefit of MonoRail's validation attributes for the automatic jQuery validation in the UI.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm trying to turn all my code around to the single responsibility principle, hence trying to sort out my coding practices.</p>

<p>So far I've come up with wordlist and domain filtering, which will give or remove points up to a certain threshold.</p>

<p>For example, if you're writing about ""v1agr4"" from a blacklisted domain, you'll get like 2 points for spam, but if you're writing about ""v1agr4"" from a hotmail.com account, you'll get only 1 ""spam point"".</p>

<p>This is one of these situations:</p>

<p>I have a simple (2 rows, 2 columns) asp:table generated dynamically. in the right column it contains a combo box <code>(cell (0, 1))</code> and a label <code>(cell (1,1))</code>. When I change the combobox's selection, the text in the label changes too. If it's too long for a cell, it re-sizes the table. I would prefer the text to be in lines, so that it fits cell's width.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's some label's property that could do it or should I specify this in CSS style of a label or of a cell? i tried setting table's width explicitly, cell's width in CSS class but nothing works and I feel like a blind in a labyrinth.</p>

<li><p>We have a central LDAP for all authentication information. This is used everywhere in the company,</p></li>
<li><p>Subversion is configured such to get the authentication information there,</p></li>
<li><p>The clients that have problems tell us that they have to change their password on some days even two or three times due to wrong authentication. The LDAP allows max X times the wrong password in a row, after that, the password has to be changed,</p></li>
<li><p>The clients that have problems tell us that they do not use any scripts or automatic clients,</p></li>

<p>A paragraph is defined by 2 linebreaks (\n). But one can have any amount of spaces/tabs together with the line breaks, and it still should be considered as a paragraph.</p>

<p>I am using python so the solution can use python's <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">regular expression syntax</a> which is extended. (can make use of <code>(?P...)</code> stuff)</p>

<h1>Examples:</h1>

<pre><code>the_str = 'paragraph1\n\nparagraph2'
# splitting should yield ['paragraph1', 'paragraph2']

the_str = 'p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t   \n     \n\tp3'
# should yield ['p1', 'p2\t\n\tstill p2', 'p3']

the_str = 'p1\n\n\n\tp2'
# should yield ['p1', '\n\tp2']
</code></pre>

<p>The best I could come with is: <code>r'[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*'</code>, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>import re
paragraphs = re.split(r'[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*', the_str)
</code></pre>

<p>but that is ugly. Anything better?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<h1>Suggestions rejected:</h1>

<p><code>r'\s*?\n\s*?\n\s*?'</code> -> That would make example 2 and 3 fail, since <code>\s</code> includes <code>\n</code>, so it would allow paragraph breaks with more than 2 <code>\n</code>s.</p>

<p>My question though is, <strong>is obfuscation effective?</strong> In a comment replying to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/551554/can-you-compile-c-without-using-the-net-framework/551565#551565"">this answer</a>, someone said that ""<em>if you're worried about source theft ... obfuscation is almost trivial to a real cracker</em>"".</p>

<p>I've looked at the output from the Community Edition of Dotfuscator: and it looks obfuscated to me! I wouldn't want to maintain that!</p>

<p>I understand that simply 'cracking' obfuscated software might be relatively easy: because you only need to find whichever location in the software implements whatever it is you want to crack (typically the license protection), and add a jump to skip that.</p>

<p>If the worry is more than just cracking by an end-user or a 'pirate' though: if the worry is ""source theft"" i.e. if you're a software vendor, and your worry is another vendor (a potential competitor) reverse-engineering your source, which they could then use in or add to their own product ... to what extent is simple obfuscation an adequate or inadequate protection against that risk?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1st edit:</strong></p>

<p>The code in question is about 20 KLOC which runs on end-user machines (a user control, not a remote service).</p>

<p>If obfuscation really is ""<em>almost trivial to a real cracker</em>"", I'd like some insight into <strong>why</strong> it's ineffective (and not just ""how much"" it's not effective).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2nd edit:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not worried about someone's reversing the algorithm: more worried about their repurposing the actual <em>implementation</em> of the algorithm (i.e. the source code) into their own product.</p>

<p>Figuring that 20 KLOC is several month's work to develop, would it take more or less than this (several months) to deobfuscate it all?</p>

<p>Is it even necessary to deobfuscate something in order to 'steal' it: or might a sane competitor simply incorporate it wholesale into their product while still obfuscated, accept that as-is it's a maintenance nightmare, and hope that it needs little maintenance? If this scenario <em>is</em> a possibility then is obfuscated .Net code any more vulnerable to this than compiled machine code is?</p>

<p>Is most of the obfuscation ""arms race"" aimed mostly at preventing people people from even 'cracking' something (e.g. finding and deleting the code fragment which implements licensing protection/enforcement), more than at preventing 'source theft'?</p>

<p>The idea behind this component is that it's a small JPanel with a label. The background (behind the label) is supposed to be white, with a colored rectangle on the left-hand side indicating the ratio of two measurements: ""actual"" and ""expected"".</p>

<p>If you had a bunch of these components aligned vertically, they'd form a bar chart, composed of horizontal bars.</p>

<p>This kind of thing should be super-simple.</p>

<p>Anyhow, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>package com.mycompany.view;

import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Rectangle;

import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class BarGraphPanel extends JPanel {

   private static final Color BACKGROUND = Color.WHITE;
   private static final Color FOREGROUND = Color.BLACK;

   private static final Color BORDER_COLOR = new Color(229, 172, 0);
   private static final Color BAR_GRAPH_COLOR = new Color(255, 255, 165);

   private int actual = 0;
   private int expected = 1;

   private JLabel label;

   public BarGraphPanel() {
      super();
      label = new JLabel();
      label.setOpaque(false);
      label.setForeground(FOREGROUND);
      super.add(label);
      super.setOpaque(true);
   }

   public void setActualAndExpected(int actual, int expected) {
      this.actual = actual;
      this.expected = expected;
   }

   @Override
   public void paint(Graphics g) {

      double proportion = (expected == 0) ? 0 : ((double) actual) / expected;
      Rectangle bounds = super.getBounds();

      g.setColor(BACKGROUND);
      g.fillRect(bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.width, bounds.height);

      g.setColor(BAR_GRAPH_COLOR);
      g.fillRect(bounds.x, bounds.y, (int) (bounds.width * proportion), bounds.height);

      g.setColor(BORDER_COLOR);
      g.drawRect(bounds.x, bounds.y, bounds.width, bounds.height);

      label.setText(String.format(""%s of %s (%.1f%%)"", actual, expected, proportion * 100));
      super.paint(g);
      g.dispose();
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the simple test harness:</p>

<pre><code>package com.mycompany.view;

import java.awt.GridLayout;

import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.UIManager;

public class MyFrame extends JFrame {

   public MyFrame() {

      super.setLayout(new GridLayout(3, 1));
      super.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(300, 200));

      BarGraphPanel a = new BarGraphPanel();
      BarGraphPanel b = new BarGraphPanel();
      BarGraphPanel c = new BarGraphPanel();

      a.setActualAndExpected(75, 100);
      b.setActualAndExpected(85, 200);
      c.setActualAndExpected(20, 300);

      super.add(a);
      super.add(b);
      super.add(c);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
         public void run() {

   }

      } catch (Throwable t) { }

      MyFrame frame = new MyFrame();
      frame.pack();
      frame.setVisible(true);
   }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The test harness creates a simple frame and then adds three of these controls.</p>

<p>The labels are all rendered correctly, which indicates to me that the paint() method is actually being called, but the rectangles aren't being drawn to the Graphics object.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>And why does Swing programming suck so much?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's my final code. Thanks, everyone, for your help!</p>

   g.drawRect(0, 0, bounds.width - 1, bounds.height - 1);

   FontMetrics metrics = g.getFontMetrics();
   String label = String.format(""%s of %s (%.1f%%)"", actual, expected, proportion * 100);

<li>If so, is the source code available?

The fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer (by means of <code>try finally</code> or .NET's <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2005/05/10/415956.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>using</code> construct</a>) seems to be markedly inferior.</p>

<p>I see why in Java there is no support for RAII since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently doesn't support deterministic destruction, but in .NET with the introduction of value-types (<code>struct</code>) we have the (seemingly) perfect candidate for RAII. A value type that's created on the stack has a well defined scope and C++ destructor semantics can be used. However the CLR does not permit a value-type to have a destructor.</p>

<p>My random searches found one argument that if a value-type is <a href=""http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive100.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">boxed</a> it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes non-deterministic. 
I feel that this argument isn't strong enough, the benefits of RAII are big enough to say that a value-type with a destructor cannot be boxed (or used as a class member).</p>

<p><strong>To cut a long story short my question is</strong>: are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce RAII to .NET?  (or do you think my argument about RAII's obvious advantages are flawed?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point. I <em>know</em> about <code>Finalize</code> and its non-deterministic characteristics, I know about the <code>using</code> construct and I feel these two options are inferior to RAII. <code>using</code> is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember (how many people forgot to put a <code>StreamReader</code> in a <code>using</code> block?). My question is a philosophical one about the language design, why is it the way it is and can it be improved?</p>

<p>For instance with a generic deterministically destructible value-type I can make the <code>using</code> and <code>lock</code> keywords redundant (achievable by library classes):</p>

<pre><code>    public struct Disposer&lt;T&gt; where T : IDisposable
    {
        T val;
        public Disposer(T t) { val = t; }
        public T Value { get { return val; } }
        ~Disposer()  // Currently illegal 
        {
            if (val != default(T))
                val.Dispose();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>stateless</li>
<li>independent from each other</li>
<li>repeatable with the same results i.e. no persisting changes</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements seem to be at odds with each other when developing for a database.  For example, I can't test Insert() without making sure the rows to be inserted aren't there yet, thus I need to call the Delete() first.  But, what if they aren't already there?  Then I would need to call the Exists() function first.</p>

<p>My eventual solution involved very large setup functions (yuck!) and an empty test case which would run first and indicate that the setup ran without problems.  This is sacrificing on the independence of the tests while maintaining their statelessness.</p>

<p>Another solution I found is to wrap the function calls in a transaction which can be easily rolled back, like <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/10/05/238201.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Roy Osherove's XtUnit</a>.  This work, but it involves another library, another dependency, and it seems a little too heavy of a solution for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>So, what has the SO community done when confronted with this situation?</p>

<hr>

<p>tgmdbm said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You typically use your favourite
  automated unit testing framework to
  perform integration tests, which is
  why some people get confused, but they
  don't follow the same rules. You are
  allowed to involve the concrete

  (because they've been unit tested).
  You are testing <strong>how your concrete

</blockquote>

<p>So if I read this correctly, there is really no way to <em>effectively</em> unit-test a Data Access Layer.  Or, would a ""unit test"" of a Data Access Layer involve testing, say, the SQL/commands generated by the classes, independent of actual interaction with the database?</p>

<p>Basically, I realized that in order to effectively use C#'s BeginReceive() on large messages, I need to either (a) read the packet length first, then read exactly that many bytes or (b) use an end-of-packet delimiter. My question is, are either of these present in protocol buffers? I haven't used them yet, but going over the documentation it doesn't seem like there is a length header or a delimiter.</p>

<p>If not, what should I do? Should I just build the message then prefix/suffix it with the length header/EOP delimiter?</p>

That is fast googlebotting!! And also amazing that Stackoverflow gets into 1st place so quickly.</p>

<p>The 2nd entry in Google was a blog entry by Fred Eaker on <a href=""http://fredeaker.blogspot.com/2007/01/character-encoding-detection.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Character encoding detection</a> that listed algorithms in various languages.</p>

<p>I found the mention of Delphi on that page, and it led me straight to <a href=""http://chsdet.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Free OpenSource ChsDet Charset Detector at SourceForge</a> written in Delphi and based on Mozilla's i18n component.</p>

It is the single entry point in general that I am curious about.</p>

<p>These days it seems that most frameworks offer a single entry point for whatever you build with them. In his talk Rasmus mentions that he thinks this is bad. It seems to me that he would be correct in this thinking. If everyone hitting the site is coming in through the same entry point wouldn't things bog down after traffic reached a certain point? Wouldn't it  be more efficient to allow people direct access to specific points in a site without having their request go through the same point? But perhaps the actual impact is not very bad? Maybe modern architecture can handle it? Maybe you have to be truly gigantic in scale before it becomes even worth considering? I'm curious as to what people on this site think about this issue.</p>

<p>Comparing the expressions <code>my_test.array[0]</code> and <code>type2_p-&gt;ptr[0]</code> according to my interpretation of the standard:</p>

  <p>""The definition of the subscript
  operator [] is that E1[E2] is
  identical to (*((E1)+(E2))).""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying this gives:</p>

<pre><code>my_test.array[0]
(*((E1)+(E2)))
(*((my_test.array)+(0)))
(*(my_test.array+0))
(*(my_test.array))
(*my_test.array)

(*((type2_p-&gt;ptr)+(0)))
(*(type2_p-&gt;ptr+0))
(*(type2_p-&gt;ptr))
(*type2_p-&gt;ptr)
*type2_p-&gt;ptr
</code></pre>

<p><code>type2_p-&gt;ptr</code> has type ""pointer to int"" and the value is the start address of <code>my_test</code>. <code>*type2_p-&gt;ptr</code> therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that <code>my_test</code> has.</p>

<p>Further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.2.2.1 Lvalues, arrays, and function designators</p>
  
  <p>""Except when it is the operand of the
  sizeof operator or the unary &amp;
  operator, ...  , an lvalue that has
  type <code>array of type</code> is converted to
  an expression with type <code>pointer to
  type</code> that points to the initial
  element of the array object and is not
  an lvalue.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>my_test.array</code> has type ""array of int"" and is as described above converted to ""pointer to int"" with the address of the first element as value. <code>*my_test.array</code> therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that the first element in the array.</p>

<p>And finally</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.5.2.1 Structure and union specifiers</p>
  
  <p>A pointer to a structure object,
  suitably converted, points to its
  initial member ..., and vice versa.
  There may be unnamed padding within a
  structure object, but not at its
  beginning, as necessary to achieve the
  appropriate alignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the first member of <code>type1_t</code> is the array, the start address of
that and the whole <code>type1_t</code> object is the same as described above.
My understanding were therefore that <code>*type2_p-&gt;ptr</code> evaluates to
an integer whose storage is at the same address that the first
element in the array and thus is identical to <code>*my_test.array</code>.</p>

<p>But this cannot be the case, because the program crashes consistently
on solaris, cygwin and linux with gcc versions 2.95.3, 3.4.4
and 4.3.2, so any environmental issue is completely out of the question.</p>

<p>Where is my reasoning wrong/what do I not understand?

<p>What I'm writing is an Intranet client management web-app. The organisation is about 6 tiers, and I need to restrict access to client groups based on tiers. Continually expanding. I have a fairly good idea how I'm going to do this, but am not sure if I'll be able to integrate it well into the pre-built admin interface. </p>

<p>I've done absolutely zero Django development otherwise I'd probably have a better idea on whether this would work or not. I probably won't use Django if the generated admin interface is going to be useless to this project - but like I said, there is a heavy reliance on fine-grained custom permissions.</p>

<p>Will Django let me build custom permissions/rules and integrate it seamlessly into the admin CRUD interface?</p>

<p>Update One: I want to use the admin app to minimise the repitition of generating CRUD interfaces, so yes I consider it a must have.</p>

<p>Update Two:</p>

<p>I want to describe the permissions required for this project.</p>

<p>A client can belong to one or many 'stores'. Full time employees should only be able to edit clients at their store (even if they belong to another store). However, they should not be able to see/edit clients at another store. Casuals should only be able to view clients based on what store they are rostered too (or if the casual is logged in as the store user - more likely).</p>

<p>Management above them need to be able to see all employees for the stores they manage, nothing more.</p>

<p>Senior management should be able to edit ALL employees and grant permissions below themselves.</p>

<p>After reading the django documentation, it says you can't (autmoatically) set permissions for a sub-set of a group. Only the entire group. Is it easy enough to mock up your own permissions for this purpose?</p>

<p>Best example I think would be Firefox. Some users have experienced it, others haven't, but it's pretty safe to say that all the previous versions of Firefox used much more memory then the current version. Yet still, functionality expands and options are added.
I'd expect the memory usage to go up as extra options and such stuff gets added.</p>

<p>So in other words, there must be methods by which to make sure your program doesn't use up the memory of the computer.</p>

<p>So, I'm turning this into a ""best-practices"" question, asking all of you what your little tricks and tweaks are to make your program do what it does, with less CPU then you'd normally think. And also, what to most certainly avoid.</p>

<p>A little side-question here: I came accross something in a book about C#.
Apparently, when coding an Enum, it's possible to set the size of the index of this Enum.
With large Enum's, you should let the compiler handle it I guess, but for an Enum which only holds like 2 or 3 items, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>public enum HTMLTYPE : sbyte
{
    HTML401,XHTML10,XHTML11
}
</code></pre>

<p>For those of you who don't know why, apparently the amount of memory reserved for the index of any Enum is automatically set to an integer in C#. So in other words, that amount of memory is going to be reserved. But when defining so little things in your Enum, an integer is a waste of space.
The book claimed that this could cut down the amount of memory used by the program. I'm wondering if this is true.</p>

<p>EDIT: indeed, it should be memory, darn me. Changed all entries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The table is called <strong>Customer</strong> - the
  data to be inserted into the row would
  be the name, addresss, telephone
  number, email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think its impossible to describe the whole thing end to end in Java or C#, and I would never expect that, but here are the questions I have popping into my head as I prepare for coding:</p>

<ul>
<li>How the URI would look (eg. if you use this URL - <a href=""http://www.example.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.example.com/</a>)?</li>
<li>What info would go into the HTTP envelope?</li>
<li>Would I use POST when writing to the database in this way?</li>
<li>Do I use a resource to store the posted data from the client? Is this even necessary if the data is being written to a database anyway?</li>
<li>When the data to be writeen into the db is recieved by the server - how do I physically insert it into the database - do I call some method on the server to actually write the data (in Java)? - <em>this doesn't seem to fit with truely REST architecture - shunning RPC calls.</em></li>
<li>Should I even be bothering writing to a DB - should I be storing my data as a resource?</li>
</ul>

<p>To do so, I will write only a hash of the password in the file. More specifically, my intention is to write the hash of the password and a random salt, plus the random salt itself, to avoid the use of rainbow and lookup tables. I also want to use key-stretching with PBKDF2, to make the computation of the hash computationally expensive. 
Finally, I would like to use a keyed hash algorithm, HMAC, for a final layer of protection.</p>

<p>I am trying to implement my thoughts in a Java code, and I have found some examples of the operations that I have presented above:</p>

<pre><code>private static byte[] pbkdf2(char[] password, byte[] salt, int iterations, int bytes)
    throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException
{
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password, salt, iterations, bytes * 8);
    SecretKeyFactory skf = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(""PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1"");
    return skf.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing that I really cannot understand is how to input my secret key as the key used by the HMAC algorithm, as it doesn't seem an input to the function. I have looked through the Java documentation, but I cannot find a solution to my question.</p>

<p>At this point, I am not really sure if I understood correctly how the different part of the encryption mechanism work, so I would accept any help on the topic.</p>

<ol>
<li>I was wondering if there is a way to resize when the image is requested from the user. Not when it was uploaded by the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>So for example a user goes to upload an image and I DO NOT RESIZE it and save another copy of the resized image.  Instead, when the image is requested by the user via an ASP.NET img control/tag it would resize the image on the fly to display it and display it via the img tag/control.</p>

<p>Why would I want to do this?</p>

<p>To save on disk space.  Most servers have a disk space limit, but not a server processing limit.  So I would like to save on disk space and use the processing space instead.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As a startup website its currently better that I save disk than saving processing time.  I don't have much money for large amount of space at this moment.  Hopefully it will change when the site launches.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Thanks guys and girls.</p>

<p>I'd like to link <code>foobar</code> to address 0x76543210, but link the standard libraries and the rest of the application normally. The application will then make use of the address of foobar, but will not reference the (possibly non-existent) memory behind it.</p>

<p>The rationale for this request is that this same source can be used on two platforms: On the native platform, <code>Register32</code> can simply be a <code>volatile uint32_t</code>, but on Linux <code>Register32</code> is a C++ object with the same size as a <code>uint32_t</code> that defines e.g. <code>operator=</code>, which will then use the address of the object and sends a request to a communication framework with that address (and the data) to perform the actual access on remote hardware. The linker would thus ensure the <code>Register32</code> fields of the struct refer to the correct ""addresses"".</p>

<p>The accesskey attribute is used to assign a key to an element. Depending on your OS, pressing Alt+that key (Windows) or Cmd+that key (Mac) will give focus to that element.</p>

<p>Here's a little something:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml11.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xml:lang=""en-us""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" /&gt;
    &lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
        a:focus{
            color:red
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a accesskey=""x"" target=""new"" href=""#""&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm working on a Windows machine. Thusly, I expect the anchor to go red when I press Alt+x. Yet it is not.
Is there something wrong with the code, or am I expecting the wrong thing to happen?</p>

<p>On Firefox, nothing happens. Google chrome opens a new tab (as it should, the target attribute say ""new"", which means open in new tab/window) and IE jumps to the anchor but does nothing further.</p>

<h2>Original question:</h2>

<p>I want to create a Windows Aero Glass window with Qt, now it looks like this:
<img src=""https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3203/goodrone.0/0_1ee1c_ecb3fc6e_L.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But after calling some <code>my_window->repaint()</code> my window's label becomes broken:
<img src=""https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3201/goodrone.0/0_1ee20_16877c58_L.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But now <strong>if I resize the window</strong> slightly, it repaints properly.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The question is</strong>: how do I erase the window background, so that widgets would paint themselves on a clean glass?</p>

<hr>

<p>The short code to reproduce the problem is (Vista with Aero):</p>

<pre><code>class Window(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        QWidget.__init__(self, *args)
        self.setLayout(QVBoxLayout())
        self.layout().addWidget(QLabel(""This is the text""))

        # let the whole window be a glass
        self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_NoSystemBackground)
        from ctypes import windll, c_int, byref
        windll.dwmapi.DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea(c_int(self.winId()), byref(c_int(-1)))
    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
        self.repaint()
</code></pre>

<p>You can click the window now, or just hit <code>Alt-Tab</code> several times.</p>

<p>Anyway, using labels with Aero Glass is not what I need, because QLabel doesn't know how to paint itself with a while glow (like the title of the window). What I need is a general way to clean the ""glass"".</p>

<p>PRESS LEFT CURSOR: action A</p>

<p>PRESS &amp; HOLD LEFT CURSOR: action B</p>

<p>Well, it's proving harder that I thought. The main problem is that both Keyboard.KEY-DOWN and Keyboard.KEY-UP fire continuously if you hold the key down. This looks weird to me although might make sense if you think about imputing text (if you are entering text and hold down a key it starts to fill the space).</p>

<p>When I was trying to tackle the problem I thought about starting a counter on the KEY-DOWN and resetting it on KEY-UP. Then if it reached certain threshold fire an event. The problem is the counter resets straight away because they KEY-UP event fires all the time.</p>

<p>I'm aware of the keyboard polling classes such as <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/bigroom/wiki/KeyPoll"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BigRoom</a>'s and <a href=""http://www.senocular.com/flash/actionscript.php?file=ActionScript_3.0/com/senocular/utils/KeyObject.as"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Senocular</a>'s but they don't solve the problem because they base their status on the same events.</p>

<p>I could go for timers starting a timer on KEY-DOWN and after x milliseconds check if the key is still down but that would assume that the key has been down all the time. I don't think it would be reliable.</p>

<p>And this is the point I'm starting to run out of ideas. Is there a much simpler method I've overlooked? I hope there is!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Reasoning:</b><br>
I have a class that performs one thing, and one thing only. It manages <i>X</i> part of the database. <i>X</i> will not change, therefor the class will not have to change. Any changes could be hazardous and introduce bugs which are not necessary. For sake of example this is one class in a project containing a googol (1.0 x 10^100) of classes. Branching for one minor class would be overly complicated, especially if half the classes were like this, you'd wind up with half a googol branches, at least.</p>

<p>If now, validation failed, the dialog will not hide. This is OK and desired. It shows my created message via FacesMassages as required. If I then close the dialogbox by myself with the ""cancel""-Button, dialog will close as expected. In the cancel()-method the object Employee will be set to a new instance of Employee (<code>this.newEmployee = new Employee()</code>) as you can see. But when I open the dialog after validation failure, the object ""newEmployee"" contains just the old values... Why does my method cancel()not work? I don't understand.</p>

If you don't want to read the essay below, here are the real questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How should I implement the <code>marshal_dump</code> and <code>marshal_load</code> methods?  even a simple example will do.</p></li>
<li><p>when <code>marshal_load</code> is called, how does it 'know' which type of object to create?  If there are multiple objects of the same type in the file, how do you tell which is which?  I am obviously confused...</p></li>
<li><p>if I have an object which represents an image, is there a different way to write it out to disk?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>My specific problem is this:</b></p>

<p>It is a bit complicated because I do not have the source code for the object I wish to serialize.</p>

<p>I am working on a mod to a game engine (RPG Maker VX using the RGSS2 game library).  There is a class called Bitmap which belongs to the (closed source) API.  I would like to save this object/image between game plays, so I need to serialize it to the save file.  I'm not a ruby pro, but I know that I can define two methods (<code>marshal_dump</code> and <code>marshal_load</code>) which will be called by the ""Marshal"" module when I attempt to serialize the object.</p>

<p>The problem is that I do not know how to implement the two methods needed.  I can actually just leave them as empty methods and it <em>seems</em> to work, but the object is actually disposed and the image data is gone.  Besides that, I don't understand what it is doing internally and obviously creating empty methods is just wrong.</p>

<p>So can anyone tell me how this stuff works internally?  I think that would help me to solve my problem.  Beyond that, is there another type of image format that I can use which I could just save to a file and avoid doing my own serialization?</p>

"581436","1","","","2009-02-24 11:33:15","","9","7998","<p>I would like to collect some best-practices on deployment of a web-application to a running Tomcat. Not long ago I had to describe the deployment process of our web-application and the process appeared rather confusing.</p>

<p>Say, we have an application in a WAR file (foo.war) correctly configured and not requiring additional configuration. In this case, the deployment process is rather easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the foo.war file to the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory. If the application starts correctly, the application will automatically deploy to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/foo directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>To undeploy the application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the foo.war file from the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps. If the application unloads correctly, it will be unloaded and the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/foo will be removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I want to override some context parameters in my running application. Having read the <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a>, all I need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a context.xml file called foo.xml</li>
<li>Copy the file to the $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, that did not work: the application would not restart. Empirically, we found out that the only working solution is when the war file is deployed to a location outside the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps.
Besides, the default values of the configurable context parameters in the WAR file should be specified in the web.xml, since context.xml in the WAR file is not read when there is a context.xml outside.</p>

<p>Here is an easy example of the foo.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;                           
&lt;Context docBase=""/path-to-deployment-directory/foo.war""&gt;
    &lt;Parameter name=""myparam"" value=""newvalue"" override=""false""/&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to specify override=false for the parameter if you want the 'newvalue' to override the value specified in the WAR's web.xml. This was not obvious for us.</p>

<p>Thus, to deploy an aplication to a running Tomcat:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a context.xml file called foo.xml</li>
<li>Copy the file to the $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ directory.</li>
<li>Copy the foo.war to the location specified in the docBase of the foo.xml; the application will deploy automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>To apply new context parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the parameter values to the foo.xml and save the file; the application will re-deploy automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>To undeploy the application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the foo.xml from the $CATALINA_BASE/conf/[enginename]/[hostname]/ directory</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that removing the foo.war will also work, but will remove the foo.xml as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>By now, I have the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it a best-practice at all to deploy a web-application without stopping the tomcat? I heard an opinion that deployment to a running tomcat is never needed since people run each application in a separate tomcat.</li>
<li>Is it a good idea to copy WAR files to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps or they should better be kept in a separate location?</li>
<li>How can I configure an application deployed to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps</li>
<li>Why there is no INFO line in the catalina.out for deployment of an application and there is one for undeployment? Is it configurable?</li>
</ol>

        Name startName As endName
        Screen.MousePointer = vbDefault
    End If
</pre>

<p>During the run, the form shows up, the ParamDef variable sets the ""company name"" and when it gets to the <strong>Report.PrintOut</strong> line which prompts to print, it throws the error.  I'm guessing the crystal report isn't receiving the ""Company Name"" to properly run the crystal report.  Does any one know how to diagnose this...either on the vb6 or crystal reports side to determine what I'm missing here?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>inserted CStr(selected) to force DomainName to be a string</li>
<li>inserted msgboxes into the for loop above and below the .setcurrentvalue line </li>
<li>inserted Case ""{?Company Name}"" statement to see if that helps setting the value</li>
<li>tried .AddCurrentValue and .SetCurrentValue functions as suggested by other forum websites</li>
<li>ruled out that it was my development environement..loaded it on another machine with the exact same vb6 crystal reports 8.5 running on winxp prof sp2 and the same errors come up.  </li>
</ul>

<p>and when I run the MsgBox(ParamDef.Value) and it also turns up blank with the same missing string error.  I also can't find any documentation on the craxdrt.ParameterFieldDefinition class to see what other hidden functions are available.  When I see the list of methods and property variables, it doesn't list SetCurrentValue as one of the functions. 
Any ideas on this?</p>

<p>Although this seems wrong to me since it is the kind of thing we were trying to get away from in ASP 3.0, I have even heard in some podcasts how ""a little bit of logic in view is ok"" since the rest of the MVC framework is taking care of the structure that we didn't have in ASP 3.0.</p>

<p>Are there any MVC conventions specifying what kind and how much logic is allowed in views?</p>
