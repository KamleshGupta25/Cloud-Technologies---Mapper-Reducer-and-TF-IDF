<p>The most recent program I had to give in compiles and runs fine under cygwin. It compiles fine under Linux, but half-way through execution produces a segmentation fault. I explained this to the grad student who gives us class and he said that cygwin's version of GCC allows for sloppier code to be compiled and executed.</p>

<p>The few references I have found via google haven't been conclusive. One thread I found said that the cause for the seg fault under Linux is a memory leak. Why would this not affect the cygwin version?</p>

<p>I would use the University's computers, but I can't use Subversion on them which would significantly hinder my efforts. (I'm new to coding and often need to be able to be able to revert to X revisions ago).</p>

<p>Is cygwin's version of GCC really more 'lax' with the code it compiles? If so, are there any obvious issues to look out for when coding? Are there any alternatives for being able to write code that will run under Linux?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. I wasn't explicit enough in my original post: that there is a bug in my code was pretty much a given for me (I am quite new to programming, and really green when it comes to C, after all). My TA implied cygwin's GCC is a less reliable compiler -allowing for much sloppier code to run- than the one found under GNU/Linux. I found this strange and so had a search on the internet, but couldn't really find any references to that fact.</p>

<p>More than blaming the compiler vs. my code, I was wondering what the reason could be for the program to run under Windows and crash under Linux. The replies re: different memory managers and heap/stack layout under Windows/Linux were illustrating in that regard.</p>

<p>Would the conclusion that cygwin's GCC is just as 'good' as GNU/Linux', and it's the underlying operating systems/sheer luck that my buggy program runs under one and not the other be pretty much correct?</p>

<p>Regarding posting the source code, it's a homework assignment so I'd prefer to find the issue myself if at all possible :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>I've accepted jalf's answer as it talks about what makes the program run under Windows and not under Linux, which was what I really wanted to know. Thanks to everyone else who contributed, they were all very interesting and informative replies.</p>

<p>When I've found the issue and fixed it I'll upload a zip file with all the source code of this non-working version, in case anyone is curious to see what the hell I did :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong></p>

<p>For those interested in seeing the code, I found the problem, and it was indeed due to pointers. I was trying to return a pointer from a function. The pointer I was trying to return was being declared inside the function and so was being destroyed once the function executed. Problematic code is commented out on lines 22-24.</p>

<p>Feel free to ridicule my code.</p>

In cases where I'm binding to controls, DataSets are fine.  But in other cases, there seems to be a fair amount of mental overhead.</p>

<p>I've played a bit with SqlDataReader, and that seems to be good for simple jaunts through a select, but I feel like there may be some other models lurking in .Net that are useful to learn more about.  I feel like all of the help I find on this just uses DataSet by default.  Maybe that and DataReader really are the best options.</p>

The ellipses are made of a triangle fan, and I'm having a hard time to draw a repeating texture of any kind on it. I was hoping there was some opengl configuration combination to do this easily.

<p>However, there is one piece of maniacal behaviour.  When editing a shell script, I try to create a comment at the current indent level, but <code>smartindent</code> will have nothing to do with it.  It insists that the comment must be at level 0 (no indent).  What's worse, it breaks shift-right ('<code>&gt;&gt;</code>' and friends) so that they do not work.  This is outright insubordination, and I'd like to know what's the best way to fix it?</p>

<p>(I'm also not keen on <code>smartindent</code>'s ideas about indenting <code>then</code> after <code>if</code>.)</p>

<p>Preferred solutions will save me manual bashing - I'm being lazy.  One option would be 'turn off <code>smartindent</code> when editing shell scripts (leave it on for the rest)'.  Another option would be guidelines on how to find the control script for <code>smartindent</code> and what to edit to change the characteristics I don't like.  The final option (which I don't need advice on how to do - just the hint that it is the best, or only, way to restore sanity) is to leave <code>smartindent</code> unset.</p>

<p>I saw the vaguely related question on ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/313359/annoying-vim-unindent-rules"">(PHP and) annoying vim unindent rules</a>""; it doesn't provide me with the direct answer, though maybe the <code>cindent</code> and related items mentioned in there are in fact part of the answer.</p>

"517206","1","528385","","2009-02-05 18:22:45","","8","8027","<p>I have been tasked to write a device driver for an embedded device which will communicate with the micro controller via the SPI interface. Eventually, the USB interface will be used to download updated code externally and used during the verification phase.</p>

<p>My question is, does anyone know of a good reference design or documentation or online tutorial which covers the implementation/design of the USB protocol stack/device driver within an embedded system? I am just starting out and reading through the 650 page USB v2.0 spec is a little daunting at the moment.</p>

<p>Just as a FYI, the micro controller that I am using is a Freescale 9S12.</p>

<p>Mark</p>

<p>Based upon goldenmean's (-AD) comments I wanted to add the following info:</p>

<p>1) The embedded device uses a custom executive and makes no use of a COTS or RTOS.  </p>

<p>2) The device will use interrupts to indicate data is ready to be retrieved from the device.  </p>

<p>3) I have read through some of the docs regarding Linux, but since I am not at all familiar with Linux it isn't very helpful at the moment (though I am hoping it will be very quickly).  </p>

<p>4) The design approach, for now at least, it to write a device driver for the USB device then a USB protocol layer (I/O) would reside on top of the device driver to interpret the data. I would assume this would be the best approach, though I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Edit - A year later</p>

<p>I just wanted to share a few items before they vanish from my mind in case I never work on a USB device again.  I ran into a few obstacles when developing code and getting it up and running for the first. </p>

<p>The first problem I ran into was that when the USB device was connected to the Host (Windows in my case) was the host issues a Reset request.  The USB device would reset and clear the interrupt enable flags.  I didn't read the literature enough to know this was happening, thus I was never receiving the Set-Up Request Interrupt.  It took me quite a while to figure this out.</p>

<p>The second problem I ran into was not handling the Set-Up Request for Set_Configuration properly.  I was handling it, but I was not processing the request correctly in that the USB device was not sending an ACK when this Set-Up Request came in.  I eventually found this out by using a hardware USB protocol analyzer.  </p>

<p>There were other issues that I ran into, but these were the two biggest ones that took me quite a while to figure out.  The other issue I had to worry about is big-endian and little-endian, Freescale 9S12 vs USB data format (Intel), respectively.</p>

<p>I ended up building the USB device driver similar to UART device drivers I had done in the past. I have posted the code to this at the following URL.</p>

<p><a href=""http://lordhog.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/usb-drive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://lordhog.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/usb-drive</a></p>

<p>I tend to use structures a lot, so people may not like them since they are not as portal as using #defines (e.g., MAX3420_SETUP_DATA_AVAIL_INT_REQR 0x20), but I like them since it makes the code more readable for me.  If anyone has questions regarding it please feel free to e-mail and I can try to give some insight to it.  The book ""USB Complete: The Developer's Guide"" was helpful, so long as you knew what areas to concentrate on.  This was a simple application and only used low-speed USB.</p>

<pre><code>\begin{figure}[htp]

    \subfigure[Figure A]{\label{fig:Sample-a}\includegraphics[scale=5]{Image1.png}}

<p>And it works when I put at the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>\usepackage{subfigure}

<p>When I'm putting together the poster, I'm using the template I've found online at <a href=""http://nxg.me.uk/docs/posters/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this website,</a> with packages like:</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass[a0]{a0poster}

\usepackage[absolute]{textpos}
\usepackage[it]{subfigure}

<p>(and I've commented out the graphics, wrapfig, and times packages from the landscape file, just in case they're interfering).</p>

<p>So what gives?  Why do I get the following error when I try to put the same figure into the a0poster document?  If I don't use subfigures, the file compiles, but then I'd have to rework all of my figures, which would be painful.</p>

"600734","1","609579","","2009-03-01 22:58:38","","8","8029","<p>I have some old java code for a REST service that uses a separate thread for every incoming request. I.e. the main loop would loop on socket.accept() and hand off the socket to a Runnable which then would start up its own background thread and invoke run on itself. This worked admiringly well for a while until recently i noticed that the lag of accept to processing the request would get unacceptable under high load. When i say admiringly well, i mean that it was handling 100-200 requests a second without significant CPU usage. The performance only degraded when other daemons were adding load as well and then only once load exceeded 5. When the machine was under high load (5-8) from a combination of other processes, the time from accept to processing would get ridiculously high (500ms to 3000ms) while the actual processing stayed sub-10ms. This is all on dual-core centos 5 systems.</p>

<p>Having been used to Threadpools on .NET, i assumed that thread creation was the culprit and i thought i'd apply the same pattern in java. Now my Runnable is executed with ThreadPool.Executor (and the pool uses and ArrayBlockingQueue). Again, it works great under most scenarios unless the machine load gets high, then the time from creating the runnable until run() is invoked exhibits about the same ridiculous timing. But worse, the system load nearly doubled (10-16) with the threadpool logic in place. So now i get the same latency problems with double the load.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that the lock contention of the queue is worse than the previous new thread start-up cost that had no locks. Can anyone share their experience of new thread vs. threadpool. And if my suspicion is correct, anyone have an alternative approach to dealing with a threadpool without lock contention?</p>

<p>I'd be tempted to just make the whole system single-threaded since i don't know how much my threading helps and IO doesn't seem to be an issue, but I do get some requests that are long-lived that would then block everything.</p>

<p>thanks,
arne</p>

<p>UPDATE: I switched over to <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);</code> and while it maintained the same processing capacity, load pretty much immediately doubled and running it for 12 hours showed load staying consistently at 2x. I guess in my case a new thread per request is cheaper.</p>

<p>Example, I have a Person table a Source table. Person.source_id maps to a row in the Source table. Each person has one Source, and each Source has none or many Person rows.</p>

<p><code>cacheCounter</code> is working great when I change the value of a source on a person. It increments <code>Source.Person_Count</code>. Cool.</p>

<p>But when it increments, it adds it to the destination source for a person, but doesn't remove it from the old value. I tried <code>updateCacheControl()</code> in <code>afterSave</code>, but that didn't do anything.</p>

<p>So then I wrote some code in my model for <code>afterSave</code> that would subtract the source source_id, but it always did this even when I wasn't even changing the <code>source_id</code>. (So the count went negative).</p>

<ul>
<li>Different Host Headers should cause different Page Titles to be displayed on the site's (one) Master Page, therefore all pages. For example, if the host header is hello.mydomain.com, the page title should be ""Hello World"" for all pages/views, while goodbye.mydomain.com should be ""Goodbye World"" for all pages/views.</li>
<li>If the host header is different than anything I have in the list, regardless of where in the application, it should redirect to /Error/NoHostHeader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I'd put this in the MasterPage Load() event, and it looks like in MVC, I could do this either in every controller (doesn't feel right to have to call this functionality in every controller), or somewhere in Global.asax (seems too... global?).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I have gotten this to work successfully using the Global.asax method combined with a Controller for actually processing the data. Only problem at this point is, all of the host header information is in a database. I would normally store the ""tenant"" information if you will in a Session variable and only do a DB call when it's not there; is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>While for all intents and purposes no leak occurs here (since your program is ending and the OS will clean up all memory once it returns), but does the standard still require -- or recommend -- the usage of <code>delete[]</code> in this case?

<p>I have a number of sets of summary statistics from various datasets: max, min, mean, median etc. I'd like to plot box-plots of these - or at least, similar plots to boxplots (I don't have UQ and LQ stats, although it may be possible to get those).</p>

<p>I don't have the original data, so I can't just use the <code>boxplot</code> function in R. Is there an easy way to do this in R when you just have the summary statistics? If not, is there an easy way to do this using another free tool?</p>

<p>Sorry in advance if this question seems frivolous (but it has resulted in a bug in my code).  I use R to call an external script, so when I say e.g. <code>paste(""abc"",100000)</code> I want it to output <code>""abc 100000""</code> and not <code>""abc 1e+05""</code>.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what it looks like on my screen:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; paste(""abc"",100000)
[1] ""abc 1e+05""
&gt; paste(""abc"",100001)
[1] ""abc 100001""
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the bizarre behaviour that my script works for the input ""100001"" but not ""100000"".</p>

<p>I realise I could create a script to convert numbers to strings however I like, but I feel I shouldn't do this if there is an internal way to do the same thing (I suspect there is some ""method"" I'm missing).</p>

<p>UPDATE: Using Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;7 &amp; .NET 2.0</p>

<p>UPDATE: Playing around some more with Spy++ and the handles it exposes, I find that if I use a different <code>hwnd</code> then I can make my window modal to the tab:</p>

<p>I was using the tab's <code>hwnd</code> as suggested by the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa752126(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IWebBrowser2.HWND doc</a>, which in Spy++ appears as class <code>TabWindowClass</code>. It has a child of class <code>Shell DocObject View</code>, which has a child of Internet_Explorer_Server. If I use the <code>hwnd</code> of the <code>Internet Explorer_Server</code> then it works correctly, for example, when I click with the mouse on other tabs, Internet&nbsp;Explorer reacts normally. When I click with the mouse on the tab of interest, it plays the windows d'oh sound and doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>I don't yet know how to programatically get the Internet_Explorer_Server <code>hwnd</code>, but it should be possible.</p>

<p>Also, for what it's worth, while playing with other window handles I was generally able to make my form modal to other applications and dialogs. So I guess the answer to my question is 'many but not all handles'... possibly it depends on the application?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Another side-note: The original reason I wanted to make my form modal to the tab instead of the whole window is that when opening a <code>MessageBox</code> from my form, passing the form as owner, the <code>MessageBox</code> would not always open on top of my form. If a new Internet&nbsp;Explorer tab had just been opened but wasn't active then the <code>MessageBox</code> would be hidden and that tab would start flashing. However, since Internet&nbsp;Explorer was disabled with my form opened modal it wasn't possible to switch to that tab, so Internet&nbsp;Explorer would be frozen. I thought that opening my form modal to the tab would solve this, but I've found another solution is to avoid using <code>MessageBox</code>: if I use a second form and <code>ShowDialog(this)</code> from my first form then the second form correctly opens to the front. So it seems that <code>Form.ShowDialog()</code> works better than <code>MessageBox.Show()</code> in some cases.

<p>The documentation for NSURLRequest says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData</p>
  
  <p>Specifies that the data for the URL load should be loaded from the originating source. No existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData</p>
  
  <p>Specifies that not only should the local cache data be ignored, but that proxies and other intermediates should be instructed to disregard their caches so far as the protocol allows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if I send an NSURLRequest with NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData (which is supposed to ignore local cache, but use remote cache if available), the headers that are sent are:</p>

<pre>
GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: XBlip1.0 CFNetwork/422.15.2 Darwin/9.6.0 (i386) (iMac8%2C1)
X-Blip-Api: 0.02
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic (...)
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Host: api.blip.pl
</pre>

<p>And the status is 200 OK. But if I use NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData, which is supposed to ignore both local and remote caches, as the name suggests, one additional header is added:</p>

<pre>
If-None-Match: ""d751713988987e9331980363e24189ce""
</pre>

<p>And the response is 304 Not Modified. I've checked the HTTP RFC, and for ""If-None-Match"" it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request (without the If-None-Match header) on that resource, (...) then the server MUST NOT perform the requested method (...) Instead, if the request method was GET or HEAD, the server SHOULD respond with a 304 (Not Modified) response</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that if I use NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData, instead of ignoring the remote cache, Cocoa tells the remote server explicitly that it <em>should</em> use remote cache, and if I use NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData, it doesn't add that line and in effect the remote cache is not used.</p>

<p>So what exactly is happening here? Did I miss something, or is Cocoa setting a wrong header?</p>

<p>In firefox, both the top and bottom menus display exactly the same.  But in IE6, the bottom version, which is identical to the top except for the carriage returns after each list element, displays with extra padding above each element.  The top version, without the carriage returns does not.  This is especially apparent (the extra padding) when rolling over the items in the bottom list.</p>

<p>It seems that IE6 is rendering the carriage returns for some reason.  For now we have just resorted to formatting our code like the top example, but this is less than ideal. Is there something we can put in the CSS to make this look proper in IE6?</p>

<p>I have a transparent <code>NSView</code> on a transparent <code>NSWindow</code>.  The view's <code>drawRect:</code> method draws some content (<code>NSImage</code>s, <code>NSBezierPath</code>s and <code>NSString</code>s) on the view but leaves parts of it transparent.</p>

<h3>Solutions already attempted</h3>

<li>Overriding the <code>NSView</code>'s <code>opaqueAncestor</code> method. Found that this was not called when clicking on any part of the view.</li>
<li>Filling portions of the transparent area with <code>[NSColor clearColor]</code> in the <code>drawRect:</code> method, and with an almost-but-not-quite-transparent colour. This had no effect.</li>
<li>Experimented with the <code>NSTrackingArea</code> class. This appears to only add support for <code>mouseEntered:</code>, <code>mouseExited:</code>, <code>mouseMoved:</code>, and <code>cursorUpdate:</code> methods, <em>not</em> <code>mouseUp:</code> and <code>mouseDown:</code>.</li>

I'm having difficulty figuring out how exactly to terminate the script with the same level of completeness that Ctrl+C does, however.</p>

<p>Here's a simple script (called <strong><code>test1</code></strong>) that does little more than wait around to be terminated.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

test -f kill_me &amp;&amp; rm kill_me

touch kill_me
tail -f kill_me
</code></pre>

<p>If this script is run in the foreground, Ctrl+C will terminate both the <code>tail</code> and the script itself. If the script is run in the background, a <code>kill %1</code> (assuming it is job 1) will also terminate both <code>tail</code> and the script.</p>

<p>However, when I try to do the same thing from a script, I'm finding that only the <code>bash</code> process running the script is terminated, while <code>tail</code> hangs around disconnected from its parent. Here's one way I tried (<strong><code>test2</code></strong>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

test -f kill_me &amp;&amp; rm kill_me

(
    touch kill_me
    tail -f kill_me

    test -f kill_me &amp;&amp; {
        kill %1
        exit
    }
done
</code></pre>

<p>If this is run, the bash subshell running in the background is terminated OK, but <code>tail</code> still hangs around.</p>

<p>If I use an explicitly separate script, like this, it still doesn't work (<strong><code>test3</code></strong>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

test -f kill_me &amp;&amp; rm kill_me

<p>In my actual case, the process creating files is not particularly instrumentable, so I can't get it to terminate of its own accord; by finding out when it has created a particular file, however, I can at that point know that it's OK to terminate it.

<p>Hi and thanks for the response.
What I'm trying to do is create some form of encapsulation. So if the javascript code does something in one user control that user control shouldn't know of the impact else where. It would raise an event in javascript which can be picked up by asp.net page rendered javascript which can in turn call a javascript method in another user control if it needs to.
The idea here is also to eliminate any need for a postback.</p>

<p>As for what to do with the multi-result situation, I actually have two things I'm trying to build. The first lists all the groups in one column thus:</p>

<p>For the master-detail, my plan was just to get a big result set from the db, and munge it in php as needed. Since there's going to be some significant post-processing in php anyway, maybe I should just do three separate queries and do the joining there. (Since I'm more comfortable with that language.)</p>

Because the number of data points can quickly become very large, I have used the <a href=""http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/org/jfree/chart/axis/ValueAxis.html#setFixedAutoRange(double)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">setFixedAutoRange(double)</a> method on the domain axis.  This restricts the graph to displaying the n most recent iterations (200 in my case).</p>

<p>This works well, except during the first 200 iterations.  The problem is that, until there have been 200 iterations, the axis includes negative values (for example, after 50 iterations, the range is from -150 to 50).  Negative iterations make no sense.  I would like the axis to start at zero rather than a negative value.  How can I achieve this?</p>

<p>I don't mind whether the axis goes from 0 to 200 initially (with the right hand part of the chart left blank until the plot fills it up) or whether it starts at 0 to 1 and grows (so that the plot is always stretched across the full width of the chart).  Either would acceptable, though I have a slight preference for the former.</p>

<li>Calling <a href=""http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/org/jfree/chart/axis/ValueAxis.html#setLowerBound(double)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">setLowerBound</a> doesn't play nicely with setFixedAutoRange.</li>

I've looked at the xsd:key and xsd:keyref and it seems like the sort of thing I'm interested in, but I'm not sure. Initially I just set attributes with the type xs:ID abd xs:IDREF, which obviously doesn't necessarily refer to a specific element as far as I could tell.</p>

<p>Basically, I have several different xml files where elements refer to other elements either in the same file or other files. It looks a lot like a relation database and I would love to use one, but the requirement is to only use XML files and so I'm at least trying to establish <em>some</em> sanity instead of just seemingly random strings relying on xml comments to define the relationships. It works for smaller projects, but it's certainly not scalable.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I am attempting to render a velocity vector line from a point. Drawing the line isn't difficult: just insert a line with length <code>velocity.length</code> into the graph. This puts the line centered at the point in the y-axis direction. We need to get this now in the proper rotation and translation.</p>

<p>The translational vector is not difficult to calculate: it is half the velocity vector. The rotational matrix, however, is being exceedingly elusive to me. Given a directional vector <code>&lt;x, y, z&gt;</code>, what's the matrix I need?</p>

<p><b>Edit 1:</b> Look; if you don't understand the question, you probably won't be able to give me an answer.</p>

<p>Here is what I currently have:</p>

<pre>                    Vector3f translation = new Vector3f();
                    translation.scale(1f/2f, body.velocity);

                    Vector3f vec_z = (Vector3f) body.velocity.clone();

                        vec_y = new Vector3f(-vec_z.y, 0f, 0f); // could be optimized
                    } else {
                        vec_y = new Vector3f(0f, 1f, 0f);
                    }
                    Vector3f vec_x = new Vector3f();
                    vec_x.cross(vec_y, vec_z);
                    vec_z.normalize();

                    vec_y.cross(vec_x, vec_z);
                    vec_y.normalize();

<p>based off of <a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article665.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>. And yes, I've tried the standard rotation matrix (vec_x.x, vec_y.x, etc) and it didn't work. I've been rotating the columns and rows to see if there's any effect.</p>

<p><b>Edit 2:</b></p>

<p>Apologies about the rude wording of my comments.</p>

<p>So it looks like there were a combination of two errors; one of which House MD pointed out (really bad naming of variables: <code>vec_z</code> was actually <code>vec_y</code>, and so on), and the other was that I needed to invert the matrix before passing it off to the rendering engine (transposing was close!). So the modified code is:</p>

<pre>                    Vector3f vec_y = (Vector3f) body.velocity.clone();
                    vec_y.normalize();

                    if (vec_y.x == 0 && vec_y.z == 0) {
                        vec_x = new Vector3f(-vec_y.y, 0f, 0f); // could be optimized
                    } else {
                        vec_x = new Vector3f(0f, 1f, 0f);
                    }

                    Vector3f vec_z = new Vector3f();
                    vec_z.cross(vec_x, vec_y);
                    vec_z.normalize();

                    vec_x.cross(vec_z, vec_y);
                    vec_x.normalize();
                    vec_x.negate();

                    Matrix3f rotation = new Matrix3f(
                        vec_x.x, vec_x.y, vec_x.z,

<p>My first thought was to somehow get all the tables aggregated into a single table with three columns; ""SearchableText"",""ResultType"",""ResultID"".  The first column would contain whatever I want searched (e.g. Performer name), the second would say what is being shown (e.g. Performer) and the third would say the item's ID (note: all my tables have auto-incrementing primary keys for ease).  The question for this idea is it possible to somehow do this dynamically or do I have to add code to have a table that automatically fills whenever a new row is updated/added/deleted from the performers and venues table (perhaps via trigger?).</p>

<p>I have a really really long string (hundreds of megabytes).  I have about 1 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>This is why building a suffix trie with counting data is too inefficient space-wise to work for me.  To quote <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia's Suffix tree</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>storing a string's suffix tree typically requires significantly more space than storing the string itself.</p>
  
  <p>The large amount of information in each edge and node makes the suffix tree very expensive, consuming about ten to twenty times the memory size of the source text in good implementations. The suffix array reduces this requirement to a factor of four, and researchers have continued to find smaller indexing structures.</p>
</blockquote>

The next destination we plan to add uses CORBA, so I am researching .NET libraries that can speak CORBA.</p>

<p>So far I have found three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://iiop-net.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">IIOP.NET</a> is an open-source project that seems to be mature and fairly active.</li>
<li><a href=""http://j-integra.intrinsyc.com/products/espresso/"" rel=""noreferrer"">J-Integra Espresso</a> is one of Intrinsyc's suite of Microsoft &lt;-> Java interoperability tools.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.borland.com/us/products/visibroker/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">VisiBroker for .NET</a> (previously named 'Janeva') is a module of Borland's VisiBroker CORBA package.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with any of these, good or bad?</p>

<p>Are there other options?</p>

<p>I could use one of the C++-based CORBA libraries (<a href=""http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">omniORB</a> and <a href=""http://www.theaceorb.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TAO</a> seem to be the top two, but there are others) via mixed native-managed C++/CLI code, but the data needs to get to and from the managed core of the server at some point, adding a performance cost for marshalling, and using native C++ libraries in a mixed-code scenario tends to be fairly painful.</p>

<p>Update - we have started to use IIOP.NET, and it is looking pretty good so far. Performance for the most recent version (1.9 sp1) seems acceptable, and the API is reasonably easy to use. I will definitely look at <a href=""http://www.ikvm.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">IKVM</a> as suggested by Todd Stout - that looks like a very interesting possibility if IIOP.NET doesn't pan out.</p>

<p>Update #2 (July 2010) - we have been using IIOP.NET in production for a while, with good results. The IIOP.NET project isn't exactly what I would call active, but then again neither is CORBA, so there doesn't seem to be a big need for a lot more development.</p>

I might have fifty thousand lines in the other program and want to filter out all of the lines that don't match a list of three thousand lines in Excel.  This type of matching takes about 30-40 minutes.  I have begun wondering if there is way to do this with Python instead since I suspect the matching process could be done in seconds.</p>

<p>I have a directory on a Windows 2000 Server<br>

<p>They are always 121,201 KB in size.  </p>

<p>Programatically can I ""capture"" the program name or service name that is dropping files in this location?</p>

<p><strong>MORE INFO:</strong><br>
I did some more research on this. I renamed the file TIFF and was able to open it.<br>
This machine functions as a document search tool via a custom written ASP.NET app.
The machine contains approx 50,000 TIFF documents on the E:\ drive. This machine also runs SQL Server 2000 w/ Full-Text Indexing turned on. Full-Text Indexing in no way touches the TIFFs - but it shouldn't because this is SQL right? But FTS does require Indexing service be turned on. The weird thing this TIFF seems to be the largest thing served off of the web server. Does IIS or Indexing Service use C:\WINNT\Temp for some kind of caching? Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>RESOLUTION (Maybe?)</strong>
This seems to be Microsoft Indexing Service.<br>
When I shut it down, none of these files get created in WINNT\Temp.<br>
It seems to grab the largest file it finds and copies it into WINNT\Temp.
This is weird. When you are dealing with a 100MB+ TIFF file, this can cause you to run out of disk space. Very annoying.<br>
Guess I will just shut down the ""Web"" branch of my Indexing Services.  </p>

You might want to know about this in order to capture information on a site you create or, as a user, to <em>prevent</em> a site from capturing data on you.</p>

<p>Here is a starting list, but I'm sure I have missed some important ones:</p>

<ol>
<li>Referrer (what web page had the link you followed to get here). This is a HTTP header.</li>
<li>IP Address of the machine you are browsing from. This is available with the HTTP headers.</li>
<li>User Agent (what browser you are using). This is a HTTP header.</li>
<li>Cookie placed on a previous visit. This is a header, available only if a cookie was placed earlier and was not deleted by the user.</li>
<li>Flash Cookie placed on a previous visit. Some users turn off cookies, but <em>very</em> few know how to turn off Flash cookies. Works like a normal cookie although it depends on Flash.</li>
<li>Web Bugs. Place something small (like a transparent single-pixel GIF) on the page that's served up from a 3rd party. Some third parties (such as DoubleClick) will have their own cookies and can correlate with other visits the user makes (for a fee!).</li>

This will fire up the user's mail client, ready for them to add their comments, and hit send. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: 
I'm in an OSGi context, so bundling JDIC would be necessary. If possible, I'd like to ship with as few dependencies as possible, and bundling up the JDIC for multiple platforms does not sound fun, especially for such a small feature.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a website, say ""my-site"" - <em><a href=""http://localhost"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost</a></em></li>
<li>In this website I have a (physical) folder ""foo"" - <em><a href=""http://localhost/foo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/foo</a></em></li>
<li>Inside the ""foo""-folder I want to have a virtual directory (application?) called ""upload"", so the URL becomes <em><a href=""http://localhost/foo/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/foo/upload</a></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that ""my-site"" is an empty website with a bunch of folders in it, ""foo"", ""bar"", ""baz"", etc.</p>

<p>So when I right click on ""foo"" and choose ""New > virtual directory"" and add my application I've written in VS.NET and then try to navigate to <a href=""http://localhost/foo/upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/foo/upload</a> I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Parser Error Message: An error occurred loading a configuration file: Failed to 
start monitoring changes to 'C:\InetPub\my-site\foo\web.config' 
because access is denied.
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, there <strong>is no</strong> web config. in the ""foo""-folder, and it shouldn't since it's only a normal folder in the site. If I add the virtual directory at the top level, at say <a href=""http://localhost/foo_upload"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost/foo_upload</a>, everything works as it should... so, what am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p>As I understand perfomance hit is not signifcant with pooling and it allows me to recover from broken connections quite easily (just a new connection will be created) but then again a connection object is a nice, relatively high-level abstraction and creating a new connection for every operation (not SQL command, but application operation) generates additional, duplicated code and feels like a waste of time/resources(?).</p>

  <p>The basic container for block I/O within the kernel is the bio structure, which is defined in <code>&lt;linux/bio.h&gt;</code>. This structure represents block I/O operations that are in flight (active) as a list of segments. A segment is a chunk of a buffer that is contiguous in memory. Thus, individual buffers need not be contiguous in memory. By
  allowing the buffers to be described in chunks, the bio structure provides the capability for the kernel to perform block I/O operations of even a single buffer from multiple locations in memory. Vector I/O such as this is called scatter-gather I/O.</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem is pretty simple. When using ASP.NET Themes you do not have much say in how your style sheets are rendered to the page.</p>

<p>The render engine adds all the style sheets you have in your themes folder in alphabetic order, using the &lt;link href=”...” notation.</p>

<p>We all know the order of the style sheets are important, luckily asp.nets shortcomings can be circumvented by prefixing the style sheets with 01, 02, ... , 99, and thus forcing the order you want (see Rusty Swayne <a href=""http://rustyswayne.com/post.aspx?id=cba116ea-b672-4c90-9f4e-18b70ca2f50a"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog post</a> on the technique for more information).</p>

<p>This is especially important if you use a reset style sheet, which I highly recommend; it makes it much easier to style a site in a consistent form across browsers (take a look at <a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reset Reloaded from Eric Meyer</a>).</p>

<p>You also miss out of the possibility to specify a media type (e.g. screen, print, projection, braille, speech). And if you prefer to include style sheets using the @import method, you are also left out in the cold.</p>

<p>Another missing option is Conditional Comment, which is especially useful if you use an “ie-fix.css” style sheet.</p>

<p>Before I explain how the StylePlaceholder and Style control resolve the above issues, credit where credit is due, my solution is inspired by <a href=""http://www.dentaku.com/2007/01/take-control-over-stylesheet-order-and-media-when-using-asp-net-2-0-themes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Per Zimmerman’s blog post</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>The StylePlaceHolder control is placed in the header section of your master page or page. It can host one or more Style controls, and will remove styles added by the render engine by default, and add its own (it will only remove styles added from the current active theme).</p>

<p>The Style control can both host inline styles in-between it’s opening and closing tags and a reference to a external style sheet file through its CssUrl property. With other properties you control how the style sheet it renders to the page.</p>

<p>Let me show an example. Consider a simple web site project with a master page and a theme with three style sheets – 01reset.css, 02style.css, 99iefix.cs. Note: I have named them using prefixing technique described earlier, as it makes for a better design time experience. Also, the tag prefix of the custom controls is “ass:”.</p>

<p>In the master page’s header section, add:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ass:StylePlaceHolder ID=""StylePlaceHolder1"" runat=""server"" SkinID=""ThemeStyles"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In your theme directory, add a skin file (e.g. Styles.skin) and add the following content:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ass:StylePlaceHolder1runat=""server"" SkinId=""ThemeStyles""&gt;
    &lt;ass:Style CssUrl=""~/App_Themes/Default/01reset.css"" /&gt;
    &lt;ass:Style CssUrl=""~/App_Themes/Default/02style.css"" /&gt;
    &lt;ass:Style CssUrl=""~/App_Themes/Default/99iefix.css"" ConditionCommentExpression=""[if IE]"" /&gt;
&lt;/ass:StylePlaceHolder1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That is basically it. There are a more properties on the Style control that can be used to control the rendering, but this is the basic setup. With that in place, you can easily add another theme and replace all the styles, since you only need to include a different skin file.</p>

<p>Now to the code that makes it all happen. I must admit that the design time experience have some quirks. It is probably due to the fact that I am not very proficient in writing custom controls (in fact, these two are my first attempts), so I would very much like input on the following. In a current WCAB/WCSF based project I am developing, I am seeing errors like this in Visual Studios design view, and I have no idea why. The site compiles and everything works online.</p>

<p>More Details:<br>
I have several sets of data stored in individual generic Lists of double.
These are lists always equal in length, and hold corresponding data items, but these lists come and go dynamically, so I can't just store corresponding data items in a class or struct cleanly.  (I'm also dealing with some legacy issues.)</p>

<p>I need to be able to sort these keyed from any one of the data sets.</p>

<p>My thought of the best way to do this is to add one level of indirection, and use an index based sort.  Such sorts have been in use for years.</p>

<p>Quick definition of index based sort <b>:</b><br>
make ""index"", an array of consecutive integers the same length as the lists, then the sort algorithm sorts the list of integers so that <code>anylist[index[N]]</code> gives the Nth item of anylist in sorted order.  The lists themselves are never re-ordered.</p>

<p>Is there any built-in C# support for doing an index sort?
I have been unable to find it... everything I have found reorders the collection itself.  My guess is support exists but I haven't looked in the right place yet.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Contrls is not a typo, its just me using a silly naming system. Contrls is a property of Component of type ObservableCollection. Also the reason I am trying to use the the ItemsTemplateSelector is that the ObservableCollection<code>&lt;</code>Control>  contains objects of generic types like Control<code>&lt;</code>int> Control<code>&lt;</code>string> etc all deriving from Control and apparently you cant create datatemplates refering to generic types.</p>

<p><strong>Update3:</strong> Removed update 2 as it was unrelated. I got the ItemTemplateSelector to work by changing StaticResource to DynamicResource. But I dont know why this works...        </p>

<p>EDIT: this is what I've come up with so far (using prototype for <code>Form.getElements(form)</code>)</p>

<pre><code>function setFormOptions(formId, params) {
  params = params.split('&amp;');
  params.each(function(pair) {
    pair = pair.split('=');
    var key = pair[0];
    var val = pair[1];
    Form.getElements(form).each(function(element) {
      if(element.name == key) {
        element.value = val;
      }
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel that it could still be faster/cleaner however.</p>

The reason to convert to LINQ is because it in many situations are easier to code LINQ and get better performance. It's related to another question here on stackoverflow:

Normally the server runs fine, but sometimes an error happens where people  are served the wrong page - <strong>the page that <em>somebody else</em> requested!</strong></p>

<p>Clues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pages being delivered are those that another user requested recently, and are otherwise delivered correctly. It's been known for two simultaneous requests to be swapped. As far as I can tell, none of the pages being incorrectly delivered are older than a few minutes.</li>
<li>It only affects the files that are being served by Tomcat. Static files like images are unaffected.</li>
<li>It doesn't happen all the time. When it does happen, it happens for everybody.</li>
<li>It seems to happen at times of peak demand. However, the demand is not yet very high - it's certainly well within the bounds of what Apache can cope with.</li>
<li>Restarting Tomcat fixed it, but only for a few minutes. Restarting Apache fixed it, but only for a few minutes.</li>
<li>The server is running Apache 2 and Tomcat 6, using a Java 6 VM on Gentoo. The connection is with AJP13, and <code>JkMount</code> directives within <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> blocks are correct.</li>
<li>There's nothing of use in any of the log files.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Further information:</strong></p>

<p>Apache does not have any form of caching turned on. All the caching-related entries in httpd.conf and related imports say, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfDefine CACHE&gt;
  LoadModule cache_module modules/mod_cache.so
&lt;/IfDefine&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>While the options for Apache don't include that flag:</p>

<pre><code>APACHE2_OPTS=""-D DEFAULT_VHOST -D INFO -D LANGUAGE -D SSL -D SSL_DEFAULT_VHOST -D PHP5 -D JK""
</code></pre>

<p>Tomcat likewise has no caching options switched on, that I can find.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/246540/apachetomcat-error-wrong-pages-being-delivered#246566"">toolkit's suggestion</a> was good, but not appropriate in this case. What leads me to believe that the error can't be within my own code is that it isn't simply a few values that are being transferred - it's the entire request, including the URL, parameters, session cookies, the whole thing. People are getting pages back saying ""You are logged in as John"", when they clearly aren't.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Based on suggestions from several people, I'm going to add the following HTTP headers to Tomcat-served pages to disable all forms of caching:</p>

<pre><code>Cache-Control: no-store
Vary: *
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully these headers will be respected not just by Apache, but also by any other caches or proxies that may be in the way. Unfortunately I have no way of deliberately reproducing this error, so I'm just going to have to wait and see if it turns up again.</p>

<p>I notice that the following headers are being included - could they be related in any way?</p>

<pre><code>Connection: Keep-Alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=66
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Apparently this happened again while I was asleep, but has stopped happening now I'm awake to see it. Again, there's nothing useful in the logs that I can see, so I have no clues to what was actually happening or how to prevent it.</p>

<p>Is there any extra information I can put in Apache or Tomcat's logs to make this easier to diagnose?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Since this has happened again a couple of times, we've changed how Apache connects to Tomcat to see if it affects things. We were using <code>mod_jk</code> with a directive like this:</p>

<pre><code>JkMount /portal ajp13
</code></pre>

<p>We've switched now to using <code>mod_proxy_ajp</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>ProxyPass /portal ajp://localhost:8009/portal
</code></pre>

<p>We'll see if it makes any difference. This error was always annoyingly unpredictable, so we can never definitively say if it's worked or not.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>We just got the error briefly on a site that was left using <code>mod_jk</code>, while a sister site on the same server using <code>mod_proxy_ajp</code> didn't show the error. This doesn't prove anything, but it does provide evidence that swithing to <code>mod_proxy_ajp</code> may have helped.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>We just got the error again last night on a site using <code>mod_proxy_ajp</code>, so clearly that hasn't solved it - <code>mod_jk</code> wasn't the source of the problem. I'm going to try the anonymous suggestion of turning off persistent connections:</p>

<pre><code>KeepAlive Off
</code></pre>

<p>If that fails as well, I'm going to be desperate enough to start investigating GlassFish.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Dammit! The problem just came back. I hadn't seen it in a while, so I was starting to think we'd finally sorted it. I hate heisenbugs.</p>

I'm thinking about rewriting the UI in WPF, but before I go there I was curious if there were any war stories about doing such a conversion.</p>

<p>I use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLBLGen"" rel=""noreferrer"">LLBLGen</a> to generate my low level data access objects, and I have a business logic layer above that. The forms are databound to the business logic objects, although the main form uses caching objects to minimize round trips on the more common navigation routes. The UI <em>never</em> speaks directly to the database: always through the UI -> business logic -> low level -> datastore path. </p>

<p>One control that I use heavily is the TreeView, which acts as a visual guide and short range navigation tool. The tree has been heavily customized with icons, highlight colors and it is the control I worry most about porting.</p>

<p>Is there a story that might convince me to go ahead and convert (or conversely, wait until Microsoft is closer to pulling the rug out from under Windows Forms)? </p>

<p>EDIT: I was asked in a comment what motivation for conversion I have. I have some concern about future proofing: I have 500,000 lines of code that were originally ASP and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript"" rel=""noreferrer"">VBScript</a>. We have been porting the functionality over time to ASP.NET and C#, but only as we make changes to the code. The upside is we have kept costs minimized, the downside is half the code remains ASP and VBScript. I'm concerned about a similar situation arising with Windows Forms applications.</p>

<p>Am I worried <em>today</em> about Windows Forms going away? Not even close to it... but the application is moving from ASP and VBScript to ASP.NET and C#, has nine years of history behind it, and probably won't be replaced this decade (instead, simply it will evolve). The desktop application is likewise a long term project with years of history.</p>

<p>But now I want to execute an SQL-Query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM SomeTable WHERE SomeGuidField=:AGuid

<p>I tried setting a <a href=""http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/Tokyo/en/Data.Win.ADODB.TADOQuery.SQL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>TADOQuery.SQL</strong></a> property to the above statement, but found no way to actually set the <code>AGuid</code> parameter such that the query can be opened. Whatever I tried resulted in the (ADO/COM) error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No value given for one or more required parameters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>TheQuery.ParamByName('AGuid').Value := QuotedString(GuidToStr(AGuid));
TheQuery.Open; // &lt;&lt;== crashes here

<p>This doesn't work either:</p>

<pre><code>TheQuery.ParamByName('AGuid').Value := GuidToStr(AGuid);
TheQuery.Open; // &lt;&lt;== crashes here

<p>I had a look at how <code>TGuidField(...).AsGuid</code> works and found that it first converts the GUID to a string and then the string to a variant (and vice versa).</p>

<p>It works fine, if I always generate the SQL-Statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM SomeTable WHERE SomeGuidField='&lt;a guid goes here&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>As I am passing that <strong>TADOQuery</strong> object around in the program I would like to only change the <code>AGuid</code>-Parameter to keep most methods agnostic on the actual SQL-Statement.</p>

<p>Is there any other way to set a GUID-Parameter than always change the complete SQL-Statement?</p>

<p>(It must be a GUID because I need a globally unique identifier to synchronize with other databases which are MS SQL or MS Access based.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
vradmilovic is right, this works:</p>

<pre><code>TheQuery.ParamByName('AGuid').Value := GuidToStr(AGuid);

The language to be interpreted is a derivative of Lisp, with application-specific builtins. Individual 'programs' will be run batch-style in the application.</p>

<p>I'm surprised that over the years I've written a couple of compilers, and several data-language translators/parsers, but I've never actually written an interpreter before. The prototype is pretty far along, implemented as a syntax tree walker, in C++. I can probably influence the architecture beyond the prototype, but not the implementation language (C++). So, constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>implementation will be in C++</li>
<li>parsing will probably be handled with a yacc/bison grammar (it is now)</li>
<li>suggestions of full VM/Interpreter ecologies like NekoVM and LLVM are probably not practical for this project. Self-contained is better, even if this sounds like NIH.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I'm really looking for is reading material on the fundamentals of implementing interpreters. I did some browsing of SO, and another site known as <a href=""http://www.lambda-the-ultimate.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lambda the Ultimate</a>, though they are more oriented toward programming language theory.</p>

<p>Some of the tidbits I've gathered so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0521545668"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lisp in Small Pieces</a>, by Christian Queinnec. The person recommending it said it ""goes from the trivial interpreter to more advanced techniques and finishes presenting bytecode and 'Scheme to C' compilers.""</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://nekovm.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NekoVM</a>. As I've mentioned above, I doubt that we'd be allowed to incorporate an entire VM framework to support this project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. Originally I suggested that this might be overkill, but having worked through a healthy chunk, I agree with @JBF. Very informative, and mind-expanding.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On Lisp</a> by Paul Graham. I've read this, and while it is an informative introduction to Lisp principles, is not enough to jump-start constructing an interpreter.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/presentations/Parrot_Implementation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Parrot Implementation</a>. This seems like a fun read. Not sure it will provide me with the fundamentals.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://peter.michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scheme from Scratch</a>. Peter Michaux is attacking various implementations of Scheme, from a quick-and-dirty Scheme interpreter written in C (for use as a bootstrap in later projects) to compiled Scheme code. Very interesting so far.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Language Implementation Patterns: Create Your Own Domain-Specific and General Programming Languages</a>, recommended in the comment thread for <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2853412/books-on-creating-interpreted-languages"">Books On Creating Interpreted Languages</a>. The book contains two chapters devoted to the practice of building interpreters, so I'm adding it to my reading queue.</p></li>
<li><em>New</em> (and yet <em>Old</em>, i.e. 1979): <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=d6cpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=writing+interactive+compilers+and+interpreters&amp;dq=writing+interactive+compilers+and+interpreters&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FzorTsDzFIj0swOb_4XMCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters</a> by P. J. Brown. This is long out of print, but is interesting in providing an outline of the various tasks associated with the implementation of a Basic interpreter. I've seen mixed reviews for this one but as it is cheap (I have it on order used for around $3.50) I'll give it a spin.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how about it? Is there a good book that takes the neophyte by the hand and shows how to build an interpreter in C/C++ for a Lisp-like language? Do you have a preference for syntax-tree walkers or bytecode interpreters?</p>

<p>To answer @JBF:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the current prototype is an interpreter, and it makes sense to me as we're accepting a path to an arbitrary code file and executing it in our application environment. The builtins are used to affect our in-memory data representation.</p></li>
<li><p>it should not be hideously slow. The current tree walker seems acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>The language is <em>based</em> on Lisp, but is not Lisp, so no standards compliance required.</p></li>
<li>As mentioned above, it's unlikely that we'll be allowed to add a full external VM/interpreter project to solve this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the other posters, I'll be checking out your citations as well. Thanks, all!</p>

So far, I run RoR on Mongrel + MySQL and it's really really slow (2-4min for some views). When I look at RoR logs, it seems that database queries aren't slow (0-10ms).</p>

<p>Is RoR slow when it converts database data to object ? Is Mongrel slow ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: First thing: I was in dev. env. In production environment, the slowest view takes 2min (which would turn down to less than 1min on a good computer, mine is 5 years old). With ruby-prof and a bit of common sense, I've found out which methods were slowing down the application. The problem is that single sql queries are called in loops on larges datasets:</p>

<pre><code>ofs = Ofkb.find_by_sql [""..some large sql query...""]

for of in ofs # About 700-1000 elements
   ops = Operation.find(..the single query..)
   etc.
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here are ruby-prof results on those methods:</p>

<pre><code> %self     total     self     wait    child    calls  name

<p>There will be many concrete implementation like this. I have created a header file say, <em>CharacterConverter.h</em> which has the abstract class <em>IConverter</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Since my concrete classes just implement the <em>DoConvertion</em> method, is it required to create separate header files for each concrete class? I mean is it required to create <em>ImageConverter.h</em>, <em>TextConverter.h</em> and so on for all concrete classes? All these header files is going to contain the same code like <em>IConverter</em> abstract class. </p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Our current work-around is to avoid committing the .classpath unless we have actually changed the dependencies, however this still means that a number of people have to fix their development environments each time the .classpath is changed.</p>

<p>However, my script is not getting executed as scheduled.</p>

<p>My application lives at <code>/data/myapp/current</code>, and the script is in <code>script/myscript.rb</code>.  I can run it manually without problem as <code>root</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>/data/myapp/current/script/runner -e production /data/myapp/current/script/myscript.rb
</code></pre>

<p>When I do that, the special log file (<code>log/myscript.log</code>) gets logged to as expected:</p>

<pre><code>Tue Mar 03 13:16:00 -0500 2009 Starting to execute script...
...
Tue Mar 03 13:19:08 -0500 2009 Finished executing script in 188.075028 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>I have it set to run with <code>cron</code> every morning at 4 am.  <code>root</code>'s crontab:</p>

<pre><code>$ crontab -l
0 4 * * * /data/myapp/current/script/runner -e production /data/myapp/current/script/myscript.rb
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, it looks like it's tried to run as recently as this morning!</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -100 /var/log/cron

</code></pre>

<p>However, there is no entry in my log file, and the data that it should update has not been getting updated.  The log file permissions (as a test) were even set to globally writable:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -lh

<p>I am running on CentOS 5.</p>

<p>So my questions are...</p>

<ol>
<li>Where else can I look for information to debug this?</li>
<li>Could this be a SELinux issue?  Is there a security context that I could set or change that might resolve this error?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you to Paul and Luke both.  It did turn out to be an environment issue, and capturing the <code>stderr</code> to a log file enabled me to find the error.</p>

Right now I am writing a <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/middleware/#topics-http-middleware"" rel=""noreferrer"">middleware</a> class to handle some stuff, and I want to set 'global' variables that my views and templates can access. What is the ""right"" way of doing this? I considered doing something like this:</p>

<h2>middleware.py</h2>

<pre><code>from django.conf import settings

class BeforeFilter(object):
    def process_request(self, request):
        settings.my_var = 'Hello World'
        return None

<h2>views.py</h2>

from django.http import HttpResponse

def myview(request):
    return HttpResponse(settings.my_var)
</code></pre>

<p>Although this works, I am not sure if it is the ""Django way"" or the ""Python way"" of doing this.</p>

<p>So, my questions are:<br>
1. Is this the right way?<br>
2. If it is the right way, what is the right way of adding variables that can be used in the actual template from the middleware? Say I want to evaluate something and I want to set a variable <code>headername</code> as 'My Site Name' in the middleware, and I want to be able to do <code>{{ headername }}</code> in all templates. Doing it the way I have it now I'd have to add <code>headername</code> to the context inside every view. Is there anyway to bypass this? I am thinking something along the lines of CakePHP's <code>$this-&gt;set('headername','My Site Name');</code><br>
3. I am using the middleware class as an equivalent of CakePHP's <code>beforeFilter</code> that runs before every view (or controller in CakePHP) is called. Is this the right way of doing this?<br>
4. Completely unrelated but it is a small question, what is a nice way of printing out the contents of a variable to the browser ala <code>print_r</code>? Say I want to see all the stuff inside the <code>request</code> that is passed into the view? Is <code>pprint</code> the answer?</p>

I suspect it's some sort of 16bit CRC, but I have not been able to find the code that's actually calculating the checksums.  </p>

<p>Checksums are stored at 4E and 64.  I don't know if they are calcuated starting from the offset in the first word at the beginning of each data section or starting after that, or on the whole range.  I have tried a number of common CRC algorithms and polynomials with no luck.  There are no references or specifications available for this application.  </p>

<p>Here is another data section with different CRCs for comparison's sake.  </p>

<pre><code>00    4E00FFFF26C014091600A01030393132

<p>The first one having some great insights and in my project i've decided to go the file route and not the DB route.</p>

<p>A major point against using the filesystem is backup. But in our system we have a great backup scheme so i am not worried about that.</p>

<p>The next path is how to store the actual files. And I've thought about having the files' location static at all times and create a virtual directory system in the database side of things. So links to the file don't change.</p>

<p>The system i am building will have one global file management so all files are accessible to all users. But many that have gone the file route talk about physical directory size (if all the files are within one directory for example)</p>

<p>So my question is, what are some tips or best practice methods in creating folders for these static files, or if i shouldn't go the virtual directory route at all.</p>

<p>(the project is on the LAMP stack (PHP) if that helps at all)</p>

<p>I have two questions regarding a DataTable.Select():  </p>

<p>1) How to escape potential apostrophes or any other characters that would cause an issue.  I'm not worried about SQL Injection.
2) How to use IN with Like, and include results that have a null.</p>

<p>1) Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any advice for the first option since every one says use parametrized (is that a word) queries which I'm pretty sure you can't do with the Datatable.select.  The situation is like so, I don't know what the values are going to be ahead of time since the list is retrieved from a textbox.  ('US' , 'Engineering' , 'Lumburg's')  I know I could parse the string before passing it to the select but I'm sure there is some ANSI built in away of doing it which I'm afraid I don't know.  I'm aware that two apostrophes in a row would escape the character if I knew where it was going to be located but I don't know the exact location when I receive it.</p>

<p>2) Ok.  Now for the actual Select Expression.  What I'm looking to do is allow the user to free form type into a text field.  This text field will use 4 different columns to filter by.  So the user could type in several items separated by space which would then perform a query per their criteria.  (like the iTunes search box which allows you to type free form album song etc or you could be specific and only search by one type of item)  </p>

<p>I know how to do an IN or a Like by themselves but I'm not sure how I could put them together (including escaping the apostrophes and including results that match but might have a null in one of the columns) and of course do something that is supported by the .Select method.</p>

<p>WHERE  (Country IN ('US' , 'Engineering' , 'Lumburg's'))
WHERE  (Country LIKE 'LU%')</p>

<p>So the user in the case above provided LU which should return a record for Lumburg.  The more information they provide would further refine the results.  Any ideas?</p>

When I initially created the DataContext.dbml file, Visual Studio used this to create a related DataContext.designer.cs file. This designer file contains the DataContext class in C# that is used throughout the app (and is derived from the XML in the dbml file) and is essential to bridging the gap between the output of SqlMetal and using the DataContext with LinqToSql.</p>

<p>However, when I make a change to the database and recreate the dbml file, the designer file never gets regenerated in my website. Instead, the old designer file is maintained (and therefore none of the changes to the DBML file are accessible through the LinqToSql DataContext class).</p>

<p>The only process I have been able to use so far to regenerate the designer file is</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Windows Explorer and delete both the dbml and designer.cs files</li>
<li>Go to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. The dbml and designer.cs files now disappear from the project.</li>
<li>Regenerate the dbml file using SqlMetal</li>
<li>Go to Visual Studio and hit Refresh in the Solution Explorer. Now the designer.cs file is recreated.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that Visual Studio will only generate the designer.cs file when a new dbml file is detected that does not yet have a designer.cs file. This process is pretty impractical, since it involves several manual steps and messes things up with source control.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can get the designer.cs file automatically regenerated without having to follow the manual delete/refresh/regenerate/delete process outlined above?</p>

My users are widely distributed geographically and linking to documents on the shared network storage doesn't always work (different addresses, DNS entries and stuff outside my control or interest) so I'm thinking about providing a database-oriented alternative.
We have a number of files from which we parse data at the client end. I'd rather like to be able to push that up to the server.</p>

<p>I'm writing an application for a company that uses a dongle.  Please don't tell me that software protection is useless, or that I should just let it fly free into the air, or that any time I spend doing this is a waste; this isn't a philosophical question about the validity of software protection, more like a how-to.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the first step in cracking a dongle-protected piece of software is to remove all the calls to the dongle from the code (ie, patch the executable).  Also as I understand it, I can create 'strong names' in .NET in order to protect the application and the assembly, as explained <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd40t7ad.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in this MSDN article</a>.</p>

<p>Is strong naming enough to ensure that my application can't be easily patched?  Or do I need to use some sort of encryption library?  If I need to use a library, which one, or where can I get information about setting this up?</p>

<p>The next step, of course, is to put important algorithms on the dongle.  I realize that these are just speed bumps to the dedicated cracker, but as our market share grows, the speed bump will help us get to the point where the sting of piracy is not so keenly felt (I hope).</p>

<p>I can't seem to get at the data the way I would in say a DataList or a GridView, and I can't seem to come up with anything else on Google or quickly leverage this one to do what I want.  The only way I can see to get at the data is going to be using a regex to go and get it (Because a man takes what he wants. He takes it all. And I'm a man, aren't I? Aren't I?).  </p>

<p>Am I on the right track (not looking for the specific regex to do this; forging that might be a followup question ;) ), or am I missing something?</p>

<hr>

<p>The Repeater in this case is set in stone so I can't switch to something more elegant.  Once upon a time I did something similar to what Alison Zhou suggested using DataLists, but it's been some time (2+ years) and I just completely forgot about doing it this way.  Yeesh, talk about overlooking something obvious. . .</p>

<p>So I did as Alison suggested and it works fine.  I don't think the viewstate is an issue here, even though this repeater can get dozens of rows.  I can't really speak to the question if doing it that way versus using the  instead (but that seems like a fine solution to me otherwise).  Obviously the latter is less of a viewstate footprint, but I'm not experienced enough to say when one approach might be preferrable to another without an extreme example in front of me.  Alison, one question: why literals and not labels?</p>

<p>Euro Micelli, I was trying to avoid a return trip to the database.  Since I'm still a little green relative to the rest of the development world, I admit I don't necessarily have a good grasp of how many database trips is ""just right"".  There wouldn't be a performance issue here (I know the app's load enough to know this), but I suppose I was trying to avoid it out of habit, since my boss tends to emphasize fewer trips where possible.</p>

One problem: I have no idea how to do this.I will need to enter data (like times on a time sheet, for exampls)  Can anyone steer me in the right direction to acquire this skill?</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL SPECS:  I wrote the original post late at night so may not have been as detailed as I should have.  Here is an example:  My client has an ERP app that they use to collect time stamps from the line workers as they perform their jobs and get projects out the door throughout the day.  This app does NOT have an API I can use to feed data into.  I have heard of a guy who was able to actually push data onto the screen in this app's windows and controls programmatically, such that the data was able to be collected into, say, an Excel worksheet, then effectively uploaded into this app.  Sort of a reverse screen-scrape.  It's not pretty like an API would be, but it works.</p>

<p>I've seen app's interact with other apps in a similar way.  One good example I can think of is SnagIt, the screenshot utility.  You can order it to screen capture a window in a particular app, and as you move your mouse around that window, the controls under the pointer will outline in red to indicate which control it will capture for you.  I think that is interesting, and probably just a step away from actually being able to type text <em>into</em> such a control.</p>

The website performs pretty good overall, with an average framerate of 32fps. But at some heavy animation parts it likes to drop a couple of frames to about 22fps. Which is not that horrible. But I'm tweaking it as much as possible to keep it running at the highest speed possible.</p>

<p>I might overlooked some tips and tricks to make this baby run even smoother. </p>

<p>So hereby I open this thread to share whatever ninja tricks ever helped you in the past. A couple of mine which I can think of right now:</p>

<p><strong>Sequencing the animation:</strong></p>

<p>Let as less as possible transitions happen at the same time, try to make it act more as a transformer, one thing at a time. Next to gaining speed in animation, you probably end up gaining more flow.</p>

"529590","1","529714","","2009-02-09 19:44:20","","22","8243","<p>I've recently been working with someone else's code and I realized that this individual has a very different philosophy regarding private variables and method parameters than I do.  I generally feel that private variables should only be used in a case when:</p>

<ol>
<li>The variable needs to be stored for recall later.</li>
<li>The data stored in the variable is used globally in the class.</li>
<li>When the variable needs to be globally manipulated (something decidedly different from the need to read the variable by every class method).</li>
<li>When it will make programming substantially easier. (Admittedly vague, but one has to be in many circumstances to avoid painting oneself into a corner).</li>
</ol>

<p>(I admit, that many of the above are slightly repetative, but they each seem different enough to merit such treatment... )<br /><br />
It just seems that this is the most efficient means of preventing changing a variable by accident.  It also seems like following these standards will allow for the eventual manipulation of external references (if the class is eventually modified), thus leaving you with further options in the future.  Is this simply a style issue (like one true bracket or Hungarian naming conventions), or do I have justification in this belief?  Is there actually a best practice in this case?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong><br />
I think this needs to be corrected.  I used ""globally"" above where I actually meant, ""globally by instance methods"" not ""globally accessible by anything, anywhere"".<br /><br />
<strong>edit2</strong><br />
An example was asked for:</p>

<pre><code>class foo
{
    private $_my_private_variable;

    public function __constructor__()
    {
     }

    public function useFoo( $variable )
    {
        // This is the line I am wondering about,
        // there does not seem to be a need for storing it.
        $this-&gt;_my_private_variable = $variable; 
        $this-&gt;_doSometing();
    }

    private function _doSomething()
    {

        /*
          do something with $this-&gt;_my_private_variable.
        */
        // This is the only place _my_private_variable is used.
        echo $this-&gt;_my_private_variable;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the way I would have done it:</p>

<pre><code>class foo
{

    public function __constructor__()
    {
     }

    public function useFoo( $variable )
    {
        $this-&gt;_doSometing( $variable );
    }

    private function _doSomething( $passed_variable )
    {
        /*
          do something with the parameter.
        */
        echo $passed_variable;
    }
}

In the best case, it will store its strings in memory in UTF-8, and allow me to convert strings from ASCII to UTF-8/UTF-16 and back. I don't need much more besides that (ok, a liberal license won't hurt).  I have seen that C++ comes with a <a href=""http://dinkumware.com/manuals/default.aspx?manual=compleat&amp;page=locale2.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&lt;locale&gt;</code></a> header, but this seems to work on <code>wchar_t</code> only, which may or may not be UTF-16 encoded, plus I'm not sure how good this is actually.</p>

<p>Uses cases are for example: On Windows, the unicode APIs expect UTF-16 strings, and I need to convert ASCII or UTF-8 strings to pass it on to the API. Same goes for XML parsing, which may come with UTF-16, but I actually only want to process internally with UTF-8 (or, for that matter, if I switch internally to UTF-16, I'll need a conversion to that anyway).</p>

<p>So far, I've taken a look at the <a href=""http://www.icu-project.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ICU</a>, which is quite huge. Moreover, it wants to be built using it own project files, while I'd prefer a library for which there is either a CMake project or which is easy to build (something like compile all these .c files, link and good to go), instead of shipping something large as the ICU along my application.</p>

As these script resources grow in size it <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is advisable to minify the resources</a> and keep your web pages as light as possible, of course. I know many developers who hand-feed their JavaScript resources into compressors after debugging and then deploy their applications.</p>

<p>When it comes to source control and automated builds in the satisfying world of continuous integration (thank you <a href=""http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CruiseControl.NET</a>); hand compression will simply not do. The only way to maintain source control and offer compressed resources is to keep JS/CSS source &amp; their minified brethren in a separate directory structure. Then register only one set of resources or the other in code-behind.  However, if a developer makes a change to JS/CSS source and then fails to re-compact it and check in both versions, then you’re code-line is now out of sync. Not to mention inelegant.</p>

<p>I am thinking that it would be nice to write a custom executable (if one does not exist yet) for the CC.NET task block which would find and compress all JavaScript and CSS resources in the target directory after the build action but before the asp.net publish to target. This way, developers would only work on JS and CSS source and users would only get the minified resources.</p>

I believe the lack of such a flexible pre-processor was a design decision made by Anders Hejlsberg (although, unfortunately, I can't find reference to this now). From experience, this is certainly a good decision, as there were some really terrible un-maintainable macros created back when I was doing a lot of C/C++. </p>

<p>That said, there are a number of scenarios where I could find a slightly more flexible pre-processor to be useful. Code such as the following could be improved by some simple pre-processor directives:</p>

<pre><code>public string MyProperty

  get { return _myProperty; }
  set
  {
    if (value != _myProperty)
    {

<pre><code>public MyClass(Guid inputId, string inputName){
    // do something
}

public MyClass(Guid inputId): this(inputId, ""foo"") {}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is of course code reuse. However, what is the best approach when there is a bit of complex logic needed? Say I want this constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass(MyOtherClass inputObject)
{
    Guid inputId = inputObject.ID;
    MyThirdClass mc = inputObject.CreateHelper();
    string inputText = mc.Text;
    mc.Dispose();
    // Need to call the main Constructor now with inputId and inputText
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The caveat here is that I need to create an object that <strong>has</strong> to be disposed after use. (Clarification: Not immediately, but I have to call Dispose() rather than waiting for Garbage Collection)</p>

<p>However, I did not see a way to just call the base constructor again if I add some code inside my overloaded constructor. Is there a way to call the base constructor from within an overloaded one?</p>

<p>Or is it possible to use</p>

<pre><code>public MyClass(MyOtherClass inputObject): this(inputObject.ID,
                                               inputObject.CreateHelper().Text) 
{}
</code></pre>

<p>Would this automatically Dispose the generated Object from CreateHelper()?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks so far. Two problems: I do not control MyOtherClass and I do not have Extension Methods (only .NET 3.0...). I do control my own class though, and since I've just started writing it, I have no problem refactoring the constructors if there is a good approach.</p>

<p>A couple of <strong>possible approaches</strong> I know about, and browser compatibility (based on a quick test):</p>

<p><strong>1) Do a <code>window.open</code> pointing to the new file.</strong>  </p>

 - IE6 blocks this.  
 - IE7 blocks this.

<p><strong>2) Create an iframe pointing to the new file.</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>- FireFox 3 seems to think this is OK. (Maybe it's because I already accepted it once?)  
 - IE6 blocks this.  
 - IE7 blocks this.

How can I do this so that at least these three browsers will not object?

<p>Bonus: is there a method that doesn't require browser-conditional statements? </p>

A: That might work, but in this particular case, I want to show them some other content while their download starts - for example, ""would you like to donate to this project?""

I know TestNG has a feature to annotate tests to assign them to groups, but I can't migrate to TestNG right now. It seems this could easily be accomplished in JUnit with some custom annotations and a custom JUnit TestRunner. I've checked both the JUnit docs and searched the web but couldn't find such a thing. Is anyone aware of such a TestRunner?</p>

<p>Update: Thanks for your replies regarding test suites. I should have addressed these in my original question. Here we go: I don't want to use test suites because they would require me to manually create and manage them, which means touching ALL my tests and arranging them into suites manually (too much work and a maintenance nightmare). All I need to do is run all unit tests, except a few that are really integration tests. So I want to annotate these, and run all others. At other times, I want to just run the integration tests. I also have the need to put a unit test into multiple groups, which is not possible with suites. Hope this helps to clear things up.</p>

<p>Update 2: If JUnit doesn't have this OOB, I'm looking for an Open Source library that adds this to JUnit (annotations + custom JUnit Test Runner).</p>

Due to the nature of the application, the size of these files can reach 100s MB per day, and often the limiting factor in application performance is file IO.  Currently, the application uses a plain ol' java.io.FileOutputStream to write data to disk.</p>

<p>Recently, we've had several developers assert that using memory-mapped files, implemented in native code (C/C++) and accessed via JNI, would provide greater performance.  However, FileOutputStream already uses native methods for its core methods (i.e. write(byte[])), so it appears a tenuous assumption without hard data or at least anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>I have several questions on this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this assertion really true? 
Will memory mapped files <strong>always</strong>
provide faster IO compared to Java's
FileOutputStream?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the class MappedByteBuffer
accessed from a FileChannel provide
the same functionality as a native
memory mapped file library accessed
via JNI?  What is MappedByteBuffer
lacking that might lead you to use a
JNI solution?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the risks of using
memory-mapped files for disk IO in a production
application? That is, applications
that have continuous uptime with
minimal reboots (once a month, max).
Real-life anecdotes from production
applications (Java or otherwise)
preferred.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Question #3 is important - I could answer this question myself <em>partially</em> by writing a ""toy"" application that perf tests IO using the various options described above, but by posting to SO I'm hoping for real-world anecdotes / data to chew on.</p>

<p>[EDIT] Clarification - each day of operation, the application creates multiple files that range in size from 100MB to 1 gig.  In total, the application might be writing out multiple gigs of data per day.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I looked on my service and it is matching examples that I'm finding in terms of the method signature returning a string.  I've also confirmed the response type is of application/json.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
Updated the response to include the outside quotes.  I'm also using a custom JavaScriptConverter to do the JSON serialization.  The custom converter just takes my object properties (in this case FirstName) and loads it and it's value into a Dictionary collection which the ASP.Net AJAX Extensions v1.0 can serialize easily.</p>

<p>EDIT3:
Looking into the issue that I was having with eval() (it caused an <code>Expected "";""</code> error), I noticed that the json property names were also enclosed in quotes.  Once I removed the quotes from the property name (not the value), eval() worked again.  Looking into the server side of this issue now.</p>

<p>I found the way to get the results that I want using a modified version of Mark Ransom's idea.</p>

<p>Fist, Mark Ransom's code determines the optimum spacing between ticks, when given the number of ticks. Sometimes this number ends up being more than twice what the highest value on the chart is, depending on how many grid lines you want.</p>

<p>What I'm doing is I'm running Mark's code with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 grid lines (ticks) to find which of those is the lowest. With a value of 23, the height of the chart goes to 25, with a grid line at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. With a value of 26, the chart's height is 30, with grid lines at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. It has the same spacing between grid lines, but there are more of them.</p>

<p>So here's the steps to just-about copy what Excel does to make charts all fancy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Temporarily bump up the chart's highest value by about 5% (so that there is always some space between the chart's highest point and the top of the chart area. We want 99.9 to round up to 120)</li>
<li>Find the optimum grid line placement
for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 grid
lines.</li>
<li>Pick out the lowest of those numbers. Remember the number of grid lines it took to get that value.</li>
<li>Now you have the optimum chart height. The lines/bar will never butt up against the top of the chart and you have the optimum number of ticks.</li>
</ol>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>function roundUp($maxValue){
    $optiMax = $maxValue * 2;
    for ($i = 5; $i &lt;= 10; $i++){
        $tmpMaxValue = bestTick($maxValue,$i);
        if (($optiMax &gt; $tmpMaxValue) and ($tmpMaxValue &gt; ($maxValue + $maxValue * 0.05))){
            $optiMax = $tmpMaxValue;
            $optiTicks = $i;
        }
    }
    return $optiMax;
}
function bestTick($maxValue, $mostTicks){
    $minimum = $maxValue / $mostTicks;
    $magnitude = pow(10,floor(log($minimum) / log(10)));
    $residual = $minimum / $magnitude;
    if ($residual &gt; 5){

    } elseif ($residual &gt; 2) {

<p>The proc runs about 8 Minutes and the execution plan shows the usage of an index with an actual row count of 1.339.241.423 which is about factor 1000 higher than the ""real"" actual rowcount of the table itself which is 1.144.640 as shown correctly by estimated row count. So the actual row count given by the query plan optimizer is definitly wrong!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kESKH.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when i copy the procs parameter values inside the proc to local variables and than use the local variables in the actual query, everything works fine - the proc runs 18 seconds and the execution plan shows the right actual row count.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As suggested by TrickyNixon, this seems to be a sign of the parameter sniffing problem. But actually, i get in both cases exact the same execution plan. Same indices are beeing used in the same order. The only difference i see is the way to high actual row count on the PK_ED_Transitions index when directly using the parametervalues.</p>

<p>I have done dbcc dbreindex and UPDATE STATISTICS already without any success.
dbcc show_statistics shows good data for the index, too.</p>

<p>The proc is created WITH RECOMPILE so every time it runs a new execution plan is getting compiled.</p>

<p>To be more specific - this one runs fast:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE  Proc [dbo].[myProc](
@Param datetime
)
WITH RECOMPILE 
as

set nocount on

declare @local datetime
set @local = @Param

select 
some columns
from 
table1
where
column = @local
group by
some other columns
</code></pre>

<p>And this version runs terribly slow, but produces exactly the same execution plan (besides the too high actual row count on an used index):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE  Proc [dbo].[myProc](
@Param datetime
)
WITH RECOMPILE 
as

set nocount on

select 
some columns
from 
table1
where
column = @Param
group by
some other columns
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?
Anybody out there who knows where Sql Server gets the actual row count value from when calculating query plans?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I tried the query on another server woth copat mode set to 90 (Sql2005). Its the same behavior. I think i will open up an ms support call, because this looks to me like a bug.</p>

d.something = 'one'

<p>I find it more aesthetically pleasing than <code>d['something']</code>. Note that accessing an undefined key returns None instead of raising an exception, which is also nice.</p>

<p>Update: Smashery makes a good point, which mhawke expands on for an easier solution. I'm wondering if there are any undesirable side effects of using <strong>dict</strong> instead of defining a new dictionary; if not, I like mhawke's solution a lot.</p>

"667746","1","667786","","2009-03-20 20:02:54","","4","8302","<p>I'm using Delphi 2007 Pro. I have a runtime package that includes a number of compound components I'm developing, which are based on TFrames.  There is also a related design package which installs these components to the tool palette.  These TFrame descendents use a number of third-party components, for various reasons, and also inherit from one another, as a class hierarchy.  So far (and with the help of some great advice here), this approach is working very well for what I want to accomplish.</p>

<p>Recently I ran into a problem, however, compiling/building the runtime package. Initially, it had to do with some conflict centering on nxEventLog.pas, the details of which unfortunately I failed to record, but was basically something along the lines of ""the definition for this method does not agree with the previous definition for it,"" like what you get when your implementation declaration doesn't agree with your class declaration.  This file is a NexusDB file (the application uses a NexusDB embedded server).</p>

<p>I tried various things, but never was successful in getting the conflict to go away.  The closest I came was upon compiling, having the IDE request adding TRUCKLOAD of completely unrelated units to the contains/uses clause.  More on this later, but if I proceeded with that, it still wouldn't work.  The nxEventLog file had not changed from its original state.</p>

<p>Unable to ferret out why this error was showing up -- it was showing up in Nexus files, not my actual package or units, and I had changed nothing in the Nexus code -- I finally went ahead and just completely uninstalled Nexus, and manually searched to try to make sure I had deleted all related dcu and bpl files, and then reinstalled it.  (I'm running Nexus 2.07)</p>

<p>Upon firing up the IDE, I got the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>
bds.exe - Entry Point Not Found<br>
---------------------------<br>
The procedure entry point<br>
@Nxsddatadictionary@TnxBaseTableDescriptor@LoadFromReader$qqrp15Classes@TReader could not be located in the dynamic link library NexusDB207sd110.bpl. <br>
---------------------------<br>
OK<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by: </p>

<blockquote>
Can't load package ....NexusDB207dv110.bpl<br>
Can't load package ....cmTPPanels_D2007_DesignReg.bpl<br>
The specified procedure oculd not be found.<br>
Do you want to attempt to load this package the next time a package is loaded?
</blockquote>

<p>Once I uninstalled the cmTPPanels runtime/design packages (my component set), via Component -> Install Package -> Remove, my other ""normal Nexus DB"" applications seem to work fine, including those which include Nexus's nxEventLog ocmponent.  This seems to indicate the problem is definitely in my install packages somewhere.</p>

<p>So, having confirmed that my Nexus installation does not seem to be the actual problem, I opened up the project group which contains both packages.  Building (or compiling) the runtime package, the Delphi IDE gives me the same dialog box I mentioned above:  </p>

<p>What's weird about this, aside from the fact that includes just about everything but the kitchen sink, is that a number of the packages mentioned aren't even relevant to the components included in this package I'm trying to install; DataSnap, Indy, IBExpress, RemObjects Data Abstract, etc -- none of these are even referenced in my components.</p>

<p>If I click ""OK"" to all these added units/packages, more chaos ensues, and it doesn't compile.</p>

<p>The NexusDB folders, and the folders which these components I'm developing reside in, are all on my Library path, with my custom components listed last.</p>

<p>I'm working on a virtual machine, and can snapshot as needed, but I can't seem to get around this problem regardless, and it's clear that I don't have enough in-depth understanding of how the compiler works to know where to look for diagnosis of the problem.  Anything anyone can mention which might help me do so, would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Suppose you have, as an example:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Data {
   public abstract String read();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And two subclasses FileData, which reads your data from some specified file, and StaticData, which just returns some pre-defined constant data.</p>

<p>Now, upon reading the file, an IOException may be thrown in FileData, but StaticData will never throw.  Most style guides recommend propagating an Exception up the call stack until a sufficient amount of context is available to effectively deal with it.</p>

<p>But I don't really want to add a throws clause to the abstract read() method.  Why?  Because Data and the complicated machinery using it knows nothing about files, it just knows about Data.  Moreover, there may be other Data subclasses (and more of them) that never throw exceptions and deliver data flawlessly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the IOException is necessary, for if the disk is unreadable (or some such) an error <em>must</em> be thrown.  So the only way out that I see is catching the IOException and throwing some RuntimeException in its place.</p>

<p>Is this the correct philosophy?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: The following code is just a dumb example of a more abstract problem - don't focus too much on time series, just the principles of ""adding extra methods"" for certain T</strong>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class Timeseries&lt;T&gt; 
{ 
    ...
    TimeSeries&lt;T&gt; Slice(...) { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case where T is double, I would like some extra methods, like <code>Integrate()</code>, <code>Interpolate()</code> and so on that make only sense for <code>double</code>, because I need to do arithmetic on them.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this, but I cannot find one that I'm satisfied with.</p>

<p><strong>1. Inherit into a special class</strong></p>

<pre><code>class TimeseriesDouble : Timeseries&lt;double&gt;
{ 
    double Interpolate(...) { ... }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>cons:</strong> <code>TimeseriesDouble.Slice()</code> will return a new <code>Timeseries&lt;double&gt;</code> object, now missing my special methods.</p>

<p><strong>2. External methods</strong></p>

<pre><code>public static double Interpolate(Timeseries&lt;double&gt; ts, ...) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>cons:</strong> Breaks with OO principles. And I don't want to put my methods away. Also, the methods might need private/protected state.</p>

<p><strong>3. Extension methods</strong></p>

<p>Same as 2, just with a nicer calling syntax.</p>

<p><strong>4. Common base class</strong></p>

<pre><code>class TimeSeries_base { ... }
class TimeSeries&lt;T&gt; : TimeSeries_base { .. typesafe versions of methods .. }
class TimeSeriesDouble : TimeSeries_base { .. typesafe versions of methods .. }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>cons:</strong> too much duplication of things from <code>TimeSeries_base</code> into the two subclasses. The base class might become just a place holder for utility functions for the sub classes.</p>

<p><strong>pro:</strong> I can now do things like <code>List&lt;TimeSeries_base&gt;</code> dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>5. Just forget about a common class</strong></p>

<p>I.e., keep <code>Timeseries&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>TimeseriesDouble</code> separate in the code.</p>

<p><strong>cons:</strong> Then I don't get all the benefit of treating a <code>TimeseriesDouble</code> like a <code>TimeSeries&lt;T&gt;</code>, e.g. combining two timeseries with ZIP(A,B), where one happens to be of doubles.</p>

The <code>className</code> parameter tells me what kind of business objects I should return (of course this doesn't make sense in this construed case because I already said I will return <code>Contract</code>s, but it's basically the situation I have in my real scenario). So I get the set of entries from somewhere and load the class of the collection's entries (the type of which is specified by <code>className</code>).</p>

<p>Now I need to construct the array to return, so I use <code>Set</code>'s <code>toArray(T[])</code> method. Using reflection, I build myself an empty Contracts array. <em>But,</em> this gives me a value of static type <code>Object</code>! So next I need to cast it to the appropriate type, which in this case is <code>Contract[]</code> (see ""asterisk-underlined"" part in the listing below).</p>

<p>My question is: Is there a way, and how, to cast to <code>Contract[]</code> as I do in the listing, <em>but determining the type of the array elements (<code>Contract</code>) only through <code>className</code></em> (or <code>entriesType</code>)? In other words, what I'd like to do is basically casting like this: <code>(entriesType[]) valueWithStaticTypeObject</code>, where entriesType be replaced by the class specified through the <code>classname</code> parameter, i.e. <code>Contract</code>.</p>

<p>Is this somehow inherently impossible, or can it be done somehow? Maybe using generics?</p>

When I click one of the items, to select it, that runs a process to open a web browser and go to a specific URL. The problem I'm having now is that when the WPF app loses focus, and the web browser opens, the item clicked inside the listbox turns white. Here's the whole ListBox XAML. I have set the selected items to transparent, so does this have something to do with the WPF app losing focus?</p>

<p>Is there something I can add tom the code that runs the process to open the web browser to set focus back to the WPF app?</p>

Each user has an ID(a number) and a password, which is stored as a salted hash.</p>

<p>I am able to figure out if a login is sucessful or not, but now I need to store that information somewhere(so that the user is not permanently logged out).</p>

<p>In the past, I've played with $_SESSION variables. However, these seem to be deleted when the user leaves the browser, which is undesired.
Also, I can not ""assume"" that the user won't try to trick the system, so it has to be safe.</p>

<p>So, here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I use <code>$_SESSION</code> or <code>$_COOKIE</code>? What are the main advantages of each of these approaches?</li>
<li>How to implement a 'Remember me' checkbox?</li>
<li>Which information should be stored in the session/cookie variable?</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that no database security issues are being taken in consideration in this particular question.</p>

<p>Regarding number 3, what I mean exactly is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I store the ID and the hashed password of the user in the cookie/session, or</li>
<li>Should I store the ID and the non-hashed password of the user in the cookie/session, or</li>
<li>Should I store a ""SessionID"" and the password(hashed or non-hashed?) or</li>
<li>Should I store a ""SessionID"", the ""ID"" and the password(once again, hashed or non-hashed)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to keep my website as safe but efficient and user-friendly as possible.
If a SessionID-based approach is taken, I'd also appreciate some explanation regarding how to store it in the database.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>EDIT: Eran's and Brian's answers combined seem to be what I need. Unfortunately, I can only mark one of them as accepted. I'll try to go ahead and implement to see which one was more useful.</p>

public class Person{
    #region variables
    private string _name = String.Empty;
    private string _surname = String.Empty;
    #region properties

        set{

        }
    }
}

<p>I have two questions related to the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I Unit test a Property that just has a getter (Like Name in the example)</li>
<li>How do I Unit test a Property with a setter and a getter (Like Surname in the example)</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to test properties that are that simple because I have already found errors in other code were Itellinsense did the wrong autocomplete and the property was not returning the correct variable.</p>

<p>Update:</p>  I am not talking about simple properties as the one in the example, they do have some logic behind them and are quite hard to debug. Writing a test that uses the setter to test the getter and vice versa is not good because if there is a fail I won't know which method to blame. I am using properties because they were added as public variables and later more logic had to be added.</p>

    public static void Go()
    {
        Test test = new Test();

        var dcs = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Test));

<p>When .NET serializes a null or an empty list, it puts in nil (for Nullable) and empty (for lists) elements into the XML.  The above example generates:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Test xmlns:i=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""&gt;
  &lt;NullableNumber i:nil=""true""/&gt;

"459725","1","468528","","2009-01-20 00:23:50","","32","8330","<p>I am new to functional programming, and now learn Haskell. As an exercise I decided to implement the explicit Euler method for 1D linear diffusion equation. While the code below works correctly, I am not happy about its performance. In fact, I am concerned with memory consumption. I believe that it is related to lazy evaluation, but cannot figure out how I can reduce its memory usage.</p>

<p>The idea of the algorithm is really simple, to make it clear in imperative terms: it takes an `array', and to every inner point it adds a value, which is calculated as a combination of the values in the point itself and in its neighbors. Boundary points are special cases.</p>

<p>So, this is my Euler1D.hs module:</p>

<pre><code>module Euler1D
( stepEuler
, makeu0
) where

-- impose zero flux condition
zeroflux :: (Floating a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
zeroflux mu (boundary:inner:xs) = [boundary+mu*2*(inner-boundary)]

-- one step of integration
stepEuler :: (Floating a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
stepEuler mu u@(x:xs) = (applyBC . (diffused mu)) u
    where
          diffused mu (left:x:[]) = []    -- ignore outer points
          diffused mu (left:x:right:xs) = -- integrate inner points
                   (x+mu*(left+right-2*x)) : diffused mu (x:right:xs)
          applyBC inner = (lbc u') ++ inner ++ (rbc u') -- boundary conditions
               where u' = [head u] ++ inner ++ [last u]
                     lbc = zeroflux mu             -- left boundary
                     rbc = (zeroflux mu) . reverse -- right boundary

-- initial condition
makeu0 :: Int -&gt; [Double]
makeu0 n = [ ((^2) . sin . (pi*) . xi) x | x &lt;- [0..n]]
    where xi x = fromIntegral x / fromIntegral n
</code></pre>

<p>And a simple Main.hs:</p>

<pre><code>module Main where

import System ( getArgs )
import Euler1D

main = do
      args &lt;- getArgs
      let n = read $ head args :: Int
      let u0 = makeu0 n
      let un = stepEuler 0.5 u0
      putStrLn $ show $ sum un
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, I also wrote <a href=""http://pastebin.com/f741f87c9"" rel=""noreferrer"">a pure C implementation</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if I try to run Haskell implementation for a sufficiently large size of the array <code>n</code>, I have:</p>

<pre><code>$ time ./eulerhs 200000
100000.00000000112

real    0m3.552s
user    0m3.304s
sys     0m0.128s
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, C version is faster by almost two orders of magnitude:</p>

<pre><code>$ time ./eulerc 200000
100000

real    0m0.088s
user    0m0.048s
sys     0m0.008s
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>EDIT</em>: This comparison is not really fair, because Haskell version is
  compiled with profiling flags, and C
  is not. If I compile both programs
  with <code>-O2</code> and both without profiling
  flags, I can increase <code>n</code>.  In this
  case <code>time ./eulerhs 1000000</code> takes
  0m2.236s, while <code>time ./eulerc
  1000000</code> takes only 0m0.293s. So the
  problem still remains with all
  optimizations and without profiling,
  it is only offset.</p>
  
  <p>I would like also to note, that memory
  allocation of the Haskell program
  seems to grow lineary with <code>n</code>.
  This is probably OK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the worst are memory requirements. My Haskell version requires <strong>over 100MB</strong> (my estimation of the bare minimum in C is <strong>4MB</strong>). I think this may be the source of the problem. According to profiling report the program spends 85% of time in GC, and</p>

<pre><code>        total time  =        0.36 secs   (18 ticks @ 20 ms)
        total alloc = 116,835,180 bytes  (excludes profiling overheads)

COST CENTRE                    MODULE               %time %alloc

makeu0                         Euler1D               61.1   34.9
stepEuler                      Euler1D               33.3   59.6
CAF:sum                        Main                   5.6    5.5
</code></pre>

<p>I was surprized to see that <code>makeu0</code> is <em>so</em> expensive. I decided that this is due to its lazy evaluation (if its thunks remain in the memory until the end of <code>stepEuler</code>).</p>

<p>I tried this change in <code>Main.hs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>   let un = u0 `seq` stepEuler 0.5 u0
</code></pre>

<p>but did not notice any difference. I have no idea how to reduce memory usage in <code>stepEuler</code>. So, my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way in Haskell to build lists / do list comprehensions strictly? In this case there is no benefit to keep it lazy.</li>
<li>How can I reduce overall memory usage in this case? I suppose, I have to make something strict, but fail to see what. In other words, if I have to put some <code>seq</code>s and bangs, where and why?</li>
<li>And finally, the most important, what is the best strategy to identify such costly constructs?</li>
</ol>

<p>I did read a chapter on profiling and optimization in <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Real World Haskell</a>, but it remains unclear how exactly I can decide what should be strict and what not.</p>

<p>Please forgive me such a long post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>EDIT2</em>: As suggested by A. Rex in comments, I tried running both
  programs in valgrind. And this is what
  I observed. For Haskell program
  (<code>n</code>=200000) it found:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>malloc/free: 33 allocs, 30 frees, 84,109 bytes allocated.
    ...
    checked 55,712,980 bytes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>And for C program (after a small fix):</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>malloc/free: 2 allocs, 2 frees, 3,200,000 bytes allocated.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>So, it appears that while Haskell
  allocates much smaller memory blocks,
  it does it often, and due to delay in
  garbage collection, they accumulate
  and remain in memory. So, I have
  another question:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Is it possible to avoid a lot of
  small allocations in Haskell?
  Basically, to declare, that I need to
  process the whole data structure
  rather than only its fragments on
  demand.</li>

Most developers seem to use svn with TortoiseSVN.  I tried this for few days and I think it's the best route to go with.</p>

<p>However, I still have some confusion about the way that svn works so here are a few questions that I'd like answered:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can I work with old lock way(checkout-modify-checkin) that vss uses?</p></li>
<li><p>Delphi forms have two files (MyForm.pas, MyForm.dfm).  When I add any control to the form, both files will be modified so I want to commit ""myform.pas"" and have ""myform.dfm"" commit with it too. Am I missing anything here?</p></li>
<li><p>The same applies for the Delphi Project file.  Because this links with other files, all of them should be committed when I change the project file.</p></li>
<li><p>What files do you have marked to be ignored in TSVN, so TSVN will not look for these files like (<em>.dcu,</em>.exe, ...), and can I export it from one Pc to other?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I now have to change the way I'm thinking in vss style, and need to change it for SVN style, but with vss, all things were managed within the IDE, which was fantastic ;-).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>5.If I commit the Delphi form(.pas &amp; dfm) and found some one already updated the version before, how do you resolve the conflict if there some new controls and events added to that form and unit(this require Delphi developer with svn).</p>

<p>Having looked into it, there are several ways of making the webservice secure - I am after some advice on which method to choose, with some views on pros and cons. </p>

<p>These are the methods I am aware of:</p>

<h2>SoapHeaders over SSL</h2>

<p>Post the UID/PWD in a Soap header and implement a SOAP extension (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130427/call-a-certain-method-before-each-webservice-call"">link</a>).<br>
Pretty straightforward to implement and should be quite secure over SSL. This is by far my preferred option due to the relative simplicity. Also, for historical reasons, I will need to consume the webservice from VBScript of all things, so the ability to just deal with simple SOAP is a bonus.
<em>However, are there any caveats? Am I going to have clients complaining this is a security risk?</em> </p>

<h2>Using WCF with TransportWithMessageCredential</h2>

<p>I found a lot of old articles referring to WS and if I am not misstaken, this is what is now provided in WCF? <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789011.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This Microsoft link</a> has a primer.<br>
If I understand it correctly, this uses certificate-based security between client and server for authentication. Is this correct or have I got it completely wrong?<br>
I suspect this will be a much bigger job, at least implementation wise. Also, I won't be able to access the Webservice directly from VBScript, so will have to write a dll it call call and then deploy that locally - correct?<br>
Is this even available in .Net 2.0?</p>

<h2>Other methods</h2>

<ul>
<li>I could disallow anonymous access to
the asmx file and use rely on IIS to
do authentication through
challenge/response. This is actually
practical in my scenario but feels
very inelegant (and no idea how to
make that work from VBScript either).</li>
<li>Passing in a UID to the method call
is a poor cousin of the SoapHeader so
I won't use that.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I would be very grateful for any advice on the best approach to this problem. If anyone has a good argument why Soap Headers are secure then I would love to hear it, as that seems like the simplest to use, as long as it is ""secure enough""</em>. </p>

<p>I have a C# program that does a lot of DNS resolutions.  Because the HTTPWebRequest component won't let me change the Host header, I can't create my own internal DNS cache.  So I have to depend on the Windows DNS cache, which doesn't appear amenable to change.</p>

<p>There's a reasonably good <a href=""http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/94d21089-411b-4bce-a823-49a77a46e7661033.mspx?mfr=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">TechNet article</a> about the DNS cache Registry settings in Windows Server 2003, but I haven't been able to prove that setting them does anything.  All the other pages I found through a Google search either reference that page, or paraphrase it, sometimes incorrectly.</p>

<p>Windows' ipconfig command has a /displaydns switch that will output the contents of the cache.  To my knowledge, that's the only way to determine the size of the DNS cache.  In my experiments on a 32 bit Windows XP box with 2 GB of memory, no matter what I set the DNS cache registry values to, I always end up with between 30 and 40 items in the cache--even after doing thousands of DNS resolutions.  On my 64-bit Windows 2008 machine with 16 GB of memory, I always get between 270 and 300 items in the cache.</p>

<p>I'm stumped.  I don't know what the answer is, but I figure one of the following is the case:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not possible to change the size of the DNS resolver cache.</li>
<li>It is possible, but the documentation is wrong.</li>
<li>The documentation is correct as far as it goes, but it’s incomplete.</li>
<li>The documentation is correct and complete, but I’m too dumb to make sense of it.</li>
<li>The documented registry entries actually changed the size of the cache, but ipconfig isn’t showing me all the entries that are in the cache. </li>
</ol>

<p>Can anybody tell me if it's possible to configure the size of the DNS resolver cache in Windows XP, Vista, or Server 2008?</p>

Let's say you started 1000, or 10000 new sessions, to get a good dataset of the GUIDs being generated. Would this make it any easier to generate a GUID that might be used for another session.   You wouldn't even have to guess a specific GUID, but just keep on trying GUIDs that might be generated at a specific period of time.</p>

<p>The problem ofcourse is that only the updatepanel gets updated and the scripts are registred outside  the update panel so no new scripts are added.</p>

The shop has been a ""VB shop"" since the days of VB3, but the prevailing opinion now is that we're a "".NET shop"" and since C# was created specifically for .NET, whereas VB.NET was a retrofit, we've decided to move forward writing C# only. The controversy revolves around the question of whether the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has a legitimate place in new development or if it is only for backward compatibility for VB6 (and older) code. A further, and more interesting question is whether the code ""under"" the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace is even .NET code of if it is really the old VB runtime carefully packaged in a .NET wrapper, making it in fact a COM interop control (similar to how WinForms wraps the non-.NET Win32 windowing API but exposes only .NET APIs for consumption).</p>

<p>To make this even more confusing, our dev team has a Microsoft Consulting Services consultant telling us Microsoft no longer supports Visual Basic, <strong>including the VB runtime underlying the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace</strong>.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for are links -- preferably to unimpeachable Microsoft sources -- to documentation that definitively answers this question one way or the other. I've already tried several search permutations on Google and not gotten any closer to getting to the bottom of this question.</p>

And they can <strong>add</strong> them, can <strong>edit</strong> them as needed while the program is running, can <strong>add (import)</strong> more people from an excel file, and then can <strong>export</strong> it to a new excel file.  So nothing is saved to the program, everything they want to do has to happen during runtime of the program and be exported to new excel file as needed.</p>

<p>So everything works fine but <strong>I want to let the user <em>search</em> the current datagrid (dataGridView1) in the program (in-app) and I can't figure out how.</strong> </p>

<p>I have it where the user can sort the columns ascending / descending (that is a built in feature of the data grid), but I would like to have the specific text search.  I don't want to make a MySqlConnection and all of that, I just want to be able to, say, go into the search button and program it (on click) to only search where searchTextBox is equal to a value in any cell of my dataGridView1, and display only those results.</p>

<p>Not sure why it's so difficult to find, is it possible?  I would think it would be simple, but I haven't been able to find out how to do it.  Below is a picture of my application as of now.  Also if you happen to have any ideas as to how to make it better for the user that would be nice. (:</p>

It works fine, but is <em>very</em> slow. For example, from the moment I click and hold on an item, to the moment the cursor changes is about 2 seconds. This is on Firefox 3.0.6. Once the item is being dragged, there's a shorter, but still noticeable delay (about half a second, I'd estimate) between when I let go of the mouse button and when the drop visibly takes place.</p>

<p>I suspect that the reason it's so slow is because the table is quite big (6 columns and about 100 rows), but it doesn't seem to me that it's obscenely big, and I wonder if there's something dumb I'm doing that is making it so slow. For example, I wonder if the JQuery code is being pointlessly applied to every element in the table each time you drag something. I don't know why that would happen, though.</p>

<p>The setup: Using Active Directory 2003, <strong>ForestA</strong> has a two-way forest trust with <strong>ForestB</strong>.  <strong>ForestB</strong> has a two-way forest trust with <strong>ForestC</strong>.  </p>

<p>In this situation is there any sort of trust relationship between ForestA and ForestC?   I've found some conflicting informaion; this first link clearly indicates the forest trust in not transitive to other forests:</p>

<p><a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755700.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Forest trusts</a></p>

<p>Forest trusts can only be created between two forests and cannot be implicitly extended to a third forest. This means that if a forest trust is created between forest 1 and forest 2, and a forest trust is also created between forest 2 and forest 3, forest 1 will not have an implicit trust with forest 3. </p>

<p>However, I can also find in the list of trust types an indication that forest trusts are transitive:</p>

<p><a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc775736.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trust types</a> </p>

<p>Trust type: Forest
Transitivity: Transitive</p>

<p>On top of this forest trusts show as ""transitive"" in the list of active directory trusts when viewed through ""Manage domains and trusts""</p>

<p>Does this mean that the forest trust is transitive <em>WITHIN</em> the trusting forest but not to other forests?  So in the previously mentioned scenario:</p>

<p><strong>ForestA</strong> &lt;-> <strong>ForestB</strong> &lt;-> <strong>ForestC</strong></p>

<p>Subdomains would pick up the forest trust through transitivity (so subdom1.<strong>ForestA</strong> would trust office7.<strong>ForestB</strong>) but there would be access shared between <strong>ForestA</strong> and <strong>ForestB</strong>.  Is this correct, or have I become confused by the rather confusing information microsoft publishes?  Does anyone have personal experience of this that they can share?</p>

To the best of my knowledge, this seems like a no-brainer optimization.  However, to satisfy my curiosity as to whether this actually happens, I created a simple test case in both C++ and <a href=""http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">D</a> and looked at the output of both GCC and Digital Mars D.  Both insisted on passing 32-byte structs by value when all the function in question did was add up the members and return the values, with no modification of the struct passed in.  The C++ version is below.</p>

<pre><code>#include ""iostream.h""

struct S {
    int i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p;
};

int foo(S s) {
    return s.i + s.j + s.k + s.l + s.m + s.n + s.o + s.p;
}

int main() {
    S s;
    int bar = foo(s);
    cout &lt;&lt; bar;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, why the heck wouldn't something like this be optimized by the compiler to pass-by-reference instead of actually pushing all those <code>int</code>s onto the stack?</p>

<p>Note:  Compiler switches used:  GCC -O2 (-O3 inlined foo().), DMD -O -inline -release.</p>

<p>Edit:  Obviously, in the general case the semantics of pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference won't be the same, such as if copy constructors are involved or the original struct is modified in the callee.  However, in a lot of real-world scenarios, the semantics will be identical in terms of observable behavior.  These are the cases I'm asking about.</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
    protected $a;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this-&gt;a = array( new B, new B );
    }

    public function __toString()
    {
        return json_encode( $this-&gt;a );
    }
}

class B
{
    protected $b = array( 'foo' =&gt; 'bar' );

    public function __toString()
    {
        return json_encode( $this-&gt;b );
    }
}

$a = new A();

echo $a;
</code></pre>

<p>The output from this is</p>

<pre><code>[{},{}]
</code></pre>

<p>When the <em>desired</em> output is</p>

<pre><code>[{""foo"":""bar""},{""foo"":""bar""}]
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I was relying on the __toString() hook to do my work for me.  But it can't, because the serialize that json_encode() uses won't call __toString().  When it encounters a nested object it simply serializes public properties only.</p>

<p>So, the question then become this: Is there a way I can develop a managed interface to JSON classes that both lets me use setters and getters for properties, but also allows me to get the JSON serialization behavior I desire?</p>

<p>If that's not clear, here's an example of an implementation that <em>won't</em> work, since the __set() hook is only called for the initial assignment</p>

<pre><code>class a
{
    public function __set( $prop, $value )
    {
        echo __METHOD__, PHP_EOL;
        $this-&gt;$prop = $value;
    }

    public function __toString()
    {
        return json_encode( $this );
    }
}

$a = new a;
$a-&gt;foo = 'bar';
$a-&gt;foo = 'baz';

echo $a;
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose I could also do something like this</p>

<pre><code>class a
{
    public $foo;

    public function setFoo( $value )
    {
        $this-&gt;foo = $value;
    }

    public function __toString()
    {
        return json_encode( $this );
    }
}

$a = new a;
$a-&gt;setFoo( 'bar' );

echo $a;
</code></pre>

<p>But then I would have to rely on the diligence of the other developers to use the setters - I can't force adherence programmtically with this solution.</p>

<p><strong>---> EDIT &lt;---</strong></p>

<p>Now with a test of Rob Elsner's response</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

class a implements IteratorAggregate 
{
    public $foo = 'bar';
    protected $bar = 'baz';

    public function getIterator()
    {
        echo __METHOD__;
    }
}

echo json_encode( new a );
</code></pre>

<p>When you execute this, you can see that the getIterator() method isn't ever invoked.</p>

<p>For example, i have a video file with name <code>myVideo.mp4</code>, i have changed it to <code>myVideo.txt</code>. So if i double-click it, the preferred text editor will open the file, and won't open the exact content.

<p>I am using a shared service (server=sharedLib) when setting up my libref, to allow users of my SAS/IntrNet application to modify and update (add new) records of a single dataset. The application will also be used to query my dataset. To minimize locking, I am only using a data step to modify and update rather than Proc SQL (which locks the entire member). However, I wonder if locking is more or less likely if only update/modify access to the data uses the share service but queries do not.</p>

<pre><code>%if &amp;type=QUERY %then %do ;
 LIBNAME lib '/myServer/library' ;
%end ;
%else %do ;
 LIBNAME lib '/myServer/library' server=shareLib ;
%end;

<p>this isn't my actual code, but I do know whether or not the request is going to just send data back or modify an existing record or add a new record (update);</p>

<p>I had originally made this distinction because we were having some failures attaching to the share service (not sure that is the correct terminology), but referencing the lib to query the data did not fail. Since then we have, I think solved this problem, but I wondering if I am setting myself up for problems.</p>

<p>The reason that this comes up is that we're evaluating a soap header's action, <strong>after</strong> it has been parsed into something manageable via the OperationContext object for WCF and <em>then</em> making decisions on that.  Right now, the simple solution seems to be basic substring'ing to keep the implementation simple, but part of me wonders if RegEx would be better or more robust.  The other part of me wonders if it'd be like using a shotgun to kill a fly in our particular scenario.</p>

<p>So I have to ask, what's the typical threshold that people use when trying to decide to use RegEx over typical string parsing.

<p>Anyway, assume I have a table that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
ID            LookupValue         SortOrder
============================================
1             A                   1000

5             C                   4000
</pre>

<p>I'm trying to find, using Linq, places where the <code>LookupValue</code> is the same, but the sort order is different (the <code>ID</code> is a PK on my Database table and is irrelevant to this exercise).</p>

<p>I thought the easiest way would be to group by the <code>LookupValue</code> and the <code>SortOrder</code> and then find places where the <code>LookupValue</code> appears more than twice in the result.</p>

<p>Right now, my code to get the grouped table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim KeySortPairs = From d In MyDataTable _
            Group By Key = d(LookupValue).ToString(), SortOrder = d(SortOrder).ToString() _
            Into Group _
            Select Key, SortOrder

<p>Looking in the debug output, the above code produces this result (which is correct):</p>

<pre>
Key    SortOrder
================
A      1000
B      2000
C      3000
C      4000
</pre>

<p>To get the duplicate <code>Key</code>'s then, I'm looking through the results like this:</p>

<pre><code>For Each Entry In KeySortPairs.Where(Function(t) t.Key.Count() &gt; 1)
    'Multiple Sort Orders!!'
Next
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, however, <em>every</em> entry in the grouped result gets returned.  Am I missing something, or shouldn't that count only give me the entries where the <code>Key</code> appears more than once?  I assume I'm making a trivial mistake due to my low-level of comfort with VB.NET, but I can't figure it out -- I've tried moving the <code>Count()</code> into a <code>WHERE</code> clause on the Linq expression, but that gave me the same thing.</p>

<pre><code>C-s C-w
</code></pre>

<p>But that isn't quite the same. It opens up the incremental search mini buffer and copies from the cursor in the current buffer to the end of the word. In Vim you'd search for the whole word, even if you are in the middle of the word when you press *.</p>

<p>I've cooked up a bit of elisp to do something similar:</p>

<pre><code>(defun find-word-under-cursor (arg)

  (if (looking-at ""\\&lt;"") () (re-search-backward ""\\&lt;"" (point-min)))

<p>That trots backwards to the start of the word before firing up isearch. I've bound it to C-+, which is easy to type on my keyboard and similar to *, so when I type <code>C-+ C-w</code> it copies from the start of the word to the search mini-buffer.</p>

<p>However, this still isn't perfect. Ideally it would regexp search for <code>""\&lt;"" word ""\&gt;""</code> to not show partial matches (searching for the word ""bar"" shouldn't match ""foobar"", just ""bar"" on its own). I tried using search-forward-regexp and concat'ing \&lt;> but this doesn't wrap in the file, doesn't highlight matches and is generally pretty lame. An isearch-* function seems the best bet, but these don't behave well when scripted.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Can anyone offer any improvements to the bit of elisp? Or is there some other way that I've overlooked?</p>

<p>Here is my scenario. Consider the following classes which is similar to what I need:</p>

<pre><code>public class Car
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List&lt;Tire&gt; Tires { get; set; }
}

public class Tire
{
    public double Pressure { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My instances of this will be an object of class Car with a List with four Tire objects. Note that I will always have a known number of objects in the list here.</p>

<p>Now I want to data bind this to a Form containing five textboxes. One textbox with the name of the car and one textbox with each of the tires pressures.</p>

<p>Any idea on how to make this work? The designer in VS does not seem to allow me to set this up by assigning to list indexes like Tires[0].Pressure.</p>

<p>My current solution is to bind to a ""BindableCar"" which would be like:</p>

<pre><code>public class BindableCar
{
    private Car _car;

    public BindableCar(Car car)
    {
        _car = car;
    }

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _car.Name; }
        set { _car.Name = value; }
    }

    public double Tire1Pressure
    {
        get { return _car.Tires[0].Pressure; }
        set { _car.Tires[0].Pressure = value; }
    }

    public double Tire2Pressure
    {
        get { return _car.Tires[1].Pressure; }
        set { _car.Tires[1].Pressure = value; }
    }

    public double Tire3Pressure
    {
        get { return _car.Tires[2].Pressure; }
        set { _car.Tires[2].Pressure = value; }
    }

    public double Tire4Pressure
    {
        get { return _car.Tires[3].Pressure; }
        set { _car.Tires[3].Pressure = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this becomes really ugly when my lists contains 20 instead of 4 objects, and for each of those objects I want to bind against 6 properties. That makes a huge ""BindableObject""!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Web ---[references]---> Controller ---[references]---> Model</p>

<p>I've created an extender class, according to documentation on the web, and written the two methods and compiled the application.</p>

<p>Now, when I go into the Public.Master page (which is my main master-page, and one of the places where I intend to use these methods), I can enter code such as below:</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= Html.IncludeScript(""\js\jquery.js"") %&gt;</code></p>

<p>The IntelliSense picks up and IncludeScript method and shows me the syntax just fine. So I'd expect that everything should work.</p>

<p>But it doesn't.</p>

We're starting on Prolog in my AI class, and it seems like there are some things there that would make programming in non-AI fields easier.  My question is this:  why hasn't logic programming caught on in the same way?</p>

<p>In this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/145489/should-logic-techniques-be-blended-into-mainstream-programming"">topic</a>, it seems that a general consensus was reached that logic programming is useful but must be proven as such.  Is there a reason why it's not seen as useful?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Perhaps I should be a bit more clear.  I'm not really asking about Prolog.  I can see why it wouldn't be a good idea to choose Prolog for most real-world applications.</p>

<p>To give an example of more what I'm talking about, consider list comprehensions/map/filter in Python.  These are clearly influenced by functional languages.  Why is it that languages such as Python haven't also picked up on these kinds of things from logic programming languages like they have functional languages?</p>

<ul>
<li>of course, not everything in Boost will ever be of use in my engineering group</li>
<li>more importantly, some of these libraries seem more polished than others</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, some libraries seem a bit toy-like to me.</p>

<p>There are a number of fairly accessible libraries that I can see putting to use after only a short period of investigation, such as <em>boost::variant</em> (I really like the <em>visitor</em> component and the fact that the compiler barfs if a visitor lacks an operator for one of the variant types). I'd use <em>boost::shared_ptr</em> except for the fact that our group already has a set of smart pointer types.</p>

<p>So based on the broad experience of Stack Overflow users, which Boost libraries</p>

<ul>
<li>have high quality?</li>
<li>are more than toys?</li>
<li>are there any which have a high entry barrier but which are well worth learning?</li>

I would only add textual labels and line breaks to this panel.
The labels should flow from left to right, wrapping to the next ""line"" if
needed. The line breaks would cause a jump to the next line.
I would also like to make the panel vertically scrollable.</p>

<p>The solution should work in Java 5. SwingX can be used.</p>

<p>Clarification: The textual labels are actually <code>JXHyperlink</code>s (from SwingX),
i.e. the panel contains clickable labels. This is the reason I cannot just use

For this to work, I have to call the Visual Studio batch file <em>vsvars32.bat</em> to set up the environment. This has to be done everytime I open a new cmd.exe, before using make.
When I try to call the batch file from my makefile, it obviously executes the batch file as
an own process, because the environment is the same afterwards.</p>

<p>The above question is not quite right, it should be like this:</p>

<p>Is it possible to call an environment-changing batch file from within a makefile, so that the changed environment persists for the other programs called in the makefile?</p>

<p>The answer to the original question is yes: you can use the built-in <em>call</em> command of cmd.exe. But since <em>call</em> is a built-in command and not a real program, it doesn't work in a makefile, only if you call a batch file from another batch file.</p>

<p>C(++):</p>

<ul>
<li>Widely used</li>
<li>Good preparation for the future (most programming positions require text-based programmers.)</li>
<li>We can expand upon our C codebase from last year</li>
<li>Allows us to better understand what our robot is doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>LabVIEW</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to visualize program flow (blocks and wires, instead of lines of code)</li>
<li>Easier to teach (Supposedly...)</li>
<li>""The future of programming is graphical.""  (Think so?)</li>
<li>Closer to the Robolab background that some new members may have.</li>
<li>Don't need to intimately know what's going on.  Simply tell the module to find the red ball, don't need to know how.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very difficult decision for us, and we've been debating for a while.  Based on those pros for each language, and on the experience you've got, <strong>what do you think the better option is?</strong> Keep in mind that we aren't necessarily going for pure efficiency.  We also hope to prepare our programmers for a future in programming.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you think that graphical languages such as LabVEIW are the future of programming?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is a graphical language easier to learn than a textual language?</strong>  I think that they should be about equally challenging to learn.</li>
<li>Seeing as we are partailly rooted in helping people learn, <strong>how much should we rely on prewritten modules, and how much should we try to write on our own?</strong>  (""Good programmers write good code, great programmers copy great code.""  But isn't it worth being a good programmer, first?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for the advice!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
I'd like to emphasize this question more:
The team captain thinks that LabVIEW is better for its ease of learning and teaching.  <strong>Is that true?</strong>  I think that C could be taught just as easily, and beginner-level tasks would still be around with C.  I'd really like to hear your opinions.  <strong>Is there any reason that typing while{} should be any more difficult than creating a ""while box?""</strong>  <strong>Isn't it just as intuitive that program flows line by line, only modified by ifs and loops, as it is intuitive that the program flows through the wire, only modified by ifs and loops!?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
I just realized that this falls under the topic of ""language debate.""  I hope it's okay, because it's about what's best for a specific branch of programming, with certain goals.  If it's not... I'm sorry...</p>

<p><strong>How you you effectively store a gps (or any floating point number) in a varchar field that can be <em>indexed</em>.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>We develop a content management system that can effectively store files of any type together with a collection of metadata.  This file/metadata is stored as follows:</p>

<pre><code>file_table              metadata_table
----------              --------------
file_id         -&gt;      file_id (number)
file_name               metadata_id (number)
file_location           metadata_value (varchar)
...etc
</code></pre>

<p>I've been asked to provide support for geo-tagging files (ie. storing gps coordinates as metadata).  Additionally, we'd also like to support files that have multiple geo-tags.</p>

<p>Now as far as I see I have a few options:</p>

<p><strong>1) Store latitude and longitude within the same metadata_value varchar (eg. '52.4343242,-1.32324').</strong></p>

<p>How would I query against this string?  Is there anything clever I can do with sql that will allow me to query against ""components"" of a string?  Could I store the coordinate as an xml string - would this help?  How can this be effectively indexed?</p>

<p><strong>2) Store latitude and longitude as separate rows in the <em>metadata_table</em>.</strong></p>

<p>This solution fixes the problem of supporting easier querying (at the expense of complexity and unwieldiness, especially when I'll be storing multiple geo-tags per file), however I'm still faced with the problem of indexing.</p>

<p>I can convert the varchars to floating point when querying, however I'm not sure whether this will ignore the index I have on <em>metadata_table.metadata_value</em> and perform table-scans instead.</p>

<p><strong>3) Create dedicated floating point fields to store gps data.</strong></p>

<p>This is the least desirable option since it goes against the grain of the design to add database fields for a specific metadata.  Not all files will store gps data.</p>

<p>Any help or advise appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm trying to keep my markup as clean as I possibly can, but I've decided that for various reasons, I need to wrap a DIV around everything in the list item after the first label, like this:</p>

<p>I would rather do this with ""unobtrusive Javascript"" via jQuery instead of littering my page with extra markup so I can keep the form semantically ""clean"".</p>

<p>I know how to write a jQuery selector to get to the first label in each list item $(""li+label"") or use :first-child. I also know how to insert things after the selection.</p>

<p>What I can't figure out (at least this late at night) is how to find everything after the first label in the list item (or basically everything in the list item except for the first label would be another way to put it) and wrap a DIV around that in the document ready function.  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Owen's code worked once I removed the single quotes from around: <pre>$('this')</pre> and set the proper decendent selector: <pre>$(""li label:first-child"")</pre> in order to only select the first label that occurs after a list item.</p>

<p>Here is what I did:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $('li label:first-child').each(function() {
        $(this).siblings().wrapAll('&lt;div class=""GroupThese""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');

The attachment_fu-based <code>Photo</code> model offers a <code>rotate</code> method that uses <code>open-uri</code> to retrieve the image from S3 and MiniMagick to perform the rotation. </p>

<p>The <code>rotate</code> method contains this line to retrieve the image for use with MiniMagick:</p>

<pre><code>temp_image = MiniMagick::Image.from_file(open(self.public_filename).path)
</code></pre>

<p><code>self.public_filename</code> returns something like </p>

<pre><code>http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucketname/photos/98/photo.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>Retrieving the image and rotating it work just fine in the running application in production and development. However, the unit test fails with</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: can't convert nil into String
    /Users/santry/Development/totspot/vendor/gems/mini_magick-1.2.3/lib/mini_magick.rb:34:in `initialize'

<p>The reason is that when the model method is called in the context of the unit test, <code>open(self.public_filename)</code> is returning a <code>StringIO</code> object that contains the image data. The <code>path</code> method on this object returns <code>nil</code> and <code>MiniMagick::Image.from_file</code> blows up.</p>

<p>When this very same model method is called from the <code>PhotosController</code>, <code>open(self.public_filename)</code> returns a <code>FileIO</code> instance tied to a file named, eg, <code>/tmp/open-uri7378-0</code> and the file contains the image data.</p>

<p>Thinking the cause must be some environmental difference between test and development, I fired up the console under the development environment. But just as in the unit test, <code>open('http://...')</code> returned a <code>StringIO</code>, <em>not</em> a <code>FileIO</code>.</p>

<p>I've traced my way through open-uri and all the relevant application-specific code and can find no reason for the difference.</p>

Still it was the only solution I knew of to play sounds with pitch and position control without learning C++ and OpenAL, so I ignored the warnings and went on with it.</p>

<p>But now I'm starting to worry. The 2.2 SDK introduced AVFoundation. Using both SoundEngine from CrashLanding (for sounds) and AVAudioPlayer (for music), I found out SoundEngine behaves strangely when the only existing AVAudioPlayer is released (all sounds stop until a new AVAudioPlayer is initiated). Around the same time as the 2.2 SDK came out, the CrashLanding sample code was mysteriously removed from the ADC site. I'm worried there are more bad surprises to come.</p>

<p>My question is, is anyone aware of an Open Source alternative to SoundEngine? Maybe even a C++ library that uses OpenAL?</p>

<p>The user launches a MyAppBootstrapperPackaged.exe (containing MyApp.msi as a resource, obtained from the internet somewhere, or email or otherwise).  MyAppBootStrapperPackaged.exe extracts MyApp.msi to a temp folder and executes it via msiexec.exe.</p>

<p>After the msiexec.exe process completes, I want MyApp.msi, MyBootstrapperEmpty.exe (AND MyApp.exe in %ProgramFiles%\MyApp folder so MyApp.exe can be assured access to MyApp.msi when it runs (for creating the below-mentioned packaged content).</p>

<p>MyAppBootstrapper*.exe could try and copy MyApp.msi to %ProgramFiles%\MyApp folder, but would need elevation to do so, and would not allow for its removal via Windows Installer uninstall process (from Add/Remove Programs or otherwise), which should be preserved.</p>

<p>Obviously (I think it's obvious - am I wrong?) I can't include the MSI as a file in my Media/CAB (chicken and egg scenario), so I believe it would have to be done via a Custom Action before the install process, adding the original MSI to the MSI DB's Media/CAB and the appropriate entry in the File table on the fly.  Can this be done and if so how?</p>

<p>Think of a content distribution model where content files are only ever to be distributed together with the App.  Content is produced by the end user via the App at run time, and packaged into a distributable EXE which includes both the App and the content.</p>

<p>MyApp's installer must remain an MSI, but may be executed by a Bootstrapper EXE.  The installed MyApp.exe must have access to both MyApp.msi and EXE is to be ""assembled"" at runtime by the App from a base (empty) MyAppBootstrapper.exe, which is also installed by the MSI, and the content created by the end-user.  The EXE's resource MSI must be the same as that used to install the App which is doing the runtime packaging.</p>

<p>WIX is not to be installed with MyApp.</p>

<p>There can be no network dependencies at run-/packaging- time (i.e. can't do the packaging via a Webservice - must be done locally).</p>

    printer.print(""hello world"");
    printer.print(0xA, BYTE); // print buffer and line feed

It's a serial (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RS-232</a>) printer, and I'm connecting it to the Arduino through a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX232"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MAX233</a> chip. I've checked and rechecked my connections through the chip, which I think are right based on a friend who has a similar setup working. I read somewhere that the TM-T88 printers need null-modem serial cables, so I bought an adapter, and that didn't seem to make any difference.</p>

<p>I'm new to electronics, so I'm completely stumped. I just want to get it to print something, so I can get to the fun part - the programming :). Any thoughts on things to test/try? I can give more detail on wiring or anything else, just didn't want this to get TOO long.</p>

However, I'm afraid people would see such a feature as an invitation to hacking, which would discourage regular players due to impossibly high scores.</p>

<p>I thought about the obvious ways of preventing such attempts (public/private key encryption, for example), but I've figured out reasonably simple ways hackers could circumvent all of my ideas (extracting the public key from the binary and thus sending fake encrypted scores, for example).</p>

<p>Currently we assume our report will have about 50-100 pages, consisting of nearly only histograms and some tables. The data is retrieved by some expensive queries from our DB.</p>

<p>After evaluating it the whole day i have several doubts regarding web app aspects.</p>

<p>1) Pagination: Of course I don't want to display all pages in a single web page. We need something like pagination. But <em>JasperReports</em> seems not to support this approach. The wepp demo, which comes with <em>JasperReports</em>, sketches the way to go: I have to create a <strong><em>JasperPrint</em></strong>, which is already the full report, allocating unrequired memory and which has performed the expensive queries. Then I could display a single page. But doing this again and again for each page does not appear as a proper solution to me.</p>

<p>2) As mentioned above, our report will mostly consist of diagrams. Images are generated during Exporting the <strong><em>JasperPrint</em></strong> to its output format. If I understand everything correct, the <strong><em>ImageServlet</em></strong>, which comes with <em>JR</em>, is capable but retrieve these images be</p>

<p>i) Reading the generated images from the file system<br/>
 ii) the exporter has stored them in the session (therefore in memory). </p>

<p>Since I think we will have a lot of images ii) is not an option, if we want to keep the memory footprint of the webapp low. But on the other hand flooding the file system with files is also not the best idea i could imagine. Does it delete the files somewhen? </p>

  <p>You may write dynamic script tags
  (using Prototype):</p>

<pre><code>new Element(""script"", {src: ""myBigCodeLibrary.js"", type: ""text/javascript""});
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The problem here is that we do not
  know when the external script file is
  fully loaded.</p>
  
  <p>We often want our dependant code on
  the very next line and like to write
  something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (iNeedSomeMore){
  Script.load(""myBigCodeLibrary.js"");  // includes code for myFancyMethod();
  myFancyMethod();                     // cool, no need for callbacks!
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>There is a smart way to inject script
  dependencies without the need of
  callbacks. You simply have to pull the
  script via a synchronous AJAX request
  and eval the script on global level.</p>
  
  <p>If you use Prototype the Script.load
  method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var Script = {
  _loadedScripts: [],
  include: function(script){
    // include script only once
    if (this._loadedScripts.include(script)){
      return false;
    }
    // request file synchronous
    var code = new Ajax.Request(script, {
      asynchronous: false, method: ""GET"",
      evalJS: false, evalJSON: false
    }).transport.responseText;
    // eval code on global level
    if (Prototype.Browser.IE) {
      window.execScript(code);
    } else if (Prototype.Browser.WebKit){
      $$(""head"").first().insert(Object.extend(
        new Element(""script"", {type: ""text/javascript""}), {text: code}
      ));
    } else {
      window.eval(code);
    }
    // remember included script
    this._loadedScripts.push(script);
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I got an excellent start from <a href=""http://bytes.com/topic/net/answers/654069-iso-iec-9797-1-cbc-mac-using-vb-net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>And I coded the algorithm as below:</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] CalculateMAC(this IPinPad pinpad, byte[] message, byte[] key)
{
    //Divide the key with Key1[ first 64 bits] and key2 [last 64 bits]
    var key1 = new byte[8];

    //divide the message into 8 bytes blocks
    //pad the last block with ""80"" and ""00"",""00"",""00"" until it reaches 8 bytes
    //if the message already can be divided by 8, then add 
    //another block ""80 00 00 00 00 00 00 00""
    Action&lt;byte[], int&gt; prepArray = (bArr, offset) =&gt;
                                     {
                                         bArr[offset] = 0; //80
                                         for (var i = offset + 1; i &lt; bArr.Length; i++)
                                             bArr[i] = 0;
                                     };
    var length = message.Length;
    var mod = length &gt; 8? length % 8: length - 8;

    var newLength = length + ((mod &lt; 0) ? -mod : (mod &gt; 0) ? 8 - mod : 0);
    //var newLength = length + ((mod &lt; 0) ? -mod : (mod &gt; 0) ? 8 - mod : 8);
    Debug.Assert(newLength % 8 == 0);

    var arr = new byte[newLength];
    Array.Copy(message, 0, arr, 0, length);
    //Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message, 0, length, arr, 0);
    prepArray(arr, length);
    //use initial vector {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0} 
    var vector = new byte[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };

    //encrypt by DES CBC algorith with the first key KEY 1
    var des = new DESCryptoServiceProvider { Mode = CipherMode.CBC };
    var cryptor = des.CreateEncryptor(key1, vector);
    var outputBuffer = new byte[arr.Length];
    cryptor.TransformBlock(arr, 0, arr.Length, outputBuffer, 0);

    //Decrypt the result by DES ECB with the second key KEY2 [Original suggestion]
    //Now I'm Encrypting
    var decOutputBuffer = new byte[outputBuffer.Length];
    des.Mode = CipherMode.ECB;
    var decryptor = des.CreateEncryptor(key2, vector);
    //var decryptor = des.CreateDecryptor(key2, vector);
    decryptor.TransformBlock(outputBuffer, 0, outputBuffer.Length, decOutputBuffer, 0);

    //Encrypt the result by DES ECB with the first key KEY1
    var finalOutputBuffer = new byte[decOutputBuffer.Length];
    var cryptor2 = des.CreateEncryptor(key1, vector);
    cryptor2.TransformBlock(decOutputBuffer, 0, decOutputBuffer.Length, finalOutputBuffer, 0);

    //take the first 4 bytes as the MAC
    var rval = new byte[4];
    Array.Copy(finalOutputBuffer, 0, rval, 0, 4);
    return rval;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I discovered there're 3 padding schemes and the one that gave me a start may not necessarily be right.  The manual came to my rescue again.  It seems the device only pads with 0s. Additional block is also nowhere mentioned so I made the below changes:</p>

<pre><code>    Action&lt;byte[], int&gt; prepArray = (bArr, offset) =&gt;
                                     {
                                         bArr[offset] = 0; ... }
</code></pre>

<p>No additional block (if mod 0 [divisible by 8] do not change array length)</p>

<pre><code>var newLength = length + ((mod &lt; 0) ? -mod : (mod &gt; 0) ? 8 - mod : 0);
</code></pre>

<p>The original suggestion wanted me to decrypt at the second step... but Valery <a href=""http://www.derkeiler.com/Newsgroups/microsoft.public.dotnet.security/2005-04/0180.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> suggests that it's encrypt all the way.  So I changed Decrypt to Encrypt.  But still I'm unable to get the requisite MAC...</p>

<p>Manual says for key ""6AC292FAA1315B4D8234B3A3D7D5933A"" [since the key should be 16 bytes, I figured the key here's hex string so I took byte values of 6A, C2, 92, FA...
new byte[] { 106, 194, 146, ...] the MAC should be 7B,40,BA,95 [4 bytes] if the message is [0x1a + byte array of MENTERODOMETER]</p>

<p>Can someone help?  Please?</p>

<hr>

<p>Since Pinpad requires that the first character in message is a 0x1a...</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] CalculateAugmentedMAC(this IPinPad pinpad, string message, byte[] key)
{
    var arr = new byte[message.Length + 1];
    var source = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(message);
    arr[0] = 0x1a; //ClearScreenIndicator
    Array.Copy(source, 0, arr, 1, source.Length);
    return CalculateMAC(pinpad, arr, key);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm calling the code above with this input:</p>

<p>*Edit:</p>

<p>To be a little more explicit so you can understand what I am trying to do, here is some more explanation.</p>

<p>Products are stored in products_mainTable
Orders are stored in orders_mainTable
Products That Have Been Ordered are stored in orders_productsTable</p>

<p>I want to create several reports based on products, orders, etc. drilling into the data and finding meaningful bits to display to the end user.</p>

<p>In this instance, I am trying to show which products have been purchased over a period of time, and are the most popular.  How many sold, for what price, and what is the breakout per order.  Maybe not the best order, but I'm just experimenting and picked this one.</p>

<p>All of the tables have relationships to other tables.  So from the product table, I can get to what orders ordered that product, etc.</p>

<p>The largest problem I am having, is understanding how LINQ works, especially with grouping, aggregate data, extensions, subqueries, etc.  It's been fun, but it's starting to get frustrating because I am having difficulty finding detailed explanations on how to do this.</p>

I type in ""localhost"" and hit enter.  Everything's fine.  Then it gets to the end, if there are errors, and prints things out using <code>more</code>.  No key that I press is recognized by <code>more</code>.  I have to Ctrl-C out of it.</p>

<p>Similarly, if I do a Subversion update, normally everything is fine.  In the case where the interactive conflict resolution happens, however, I'll usually type in ""tf"" for ""theirs-full"" and hit enter, but nothing happens.  I have to Ctrl-C out of it and re-run the update with force merge or use TortoiseSVN in Windows to do it.</p>

<p>Any idea why Cygwin seems to randomly not be passing the enter key through to the programs?  I considered that it may have something to do with Unix vs Windows style line endings, so I've tried typing those characters manually, but that doesn't seem to make a difference.  Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just had this happen to me again and I realized something.  It was SVN prompting me for a password.  I typed in the password, which it echoed to the screen (bad) and hit enter... nothing.  Hit enter a few more times, the cursor moves, but nothing happens.  I hit Ctrl-C and it dumps me back to bash, which then says ""bash: [my password]: command not found"" followed by a number of new prompts equal to the number of times I hit the enter key.  So what happened is the input never made it to SVN, but somehow got read by bash after SVN exited.  I thought that may help someone figure out what is going on.</p>

I've got a few TestNG cases that, if run within the primary batch of test cases, wreak havock throughout the other test cases. Rather than going through and changing all our test cases, I've made a group for the involved cases. I run the main test suite, excluding that group, and then make a second Ant call to run the affected group. This way all test cases pass, but I'm ending up having to create two TestNG reports so that the first one doesn't get overriden with the results from the second group.</p>

<p>So here's my question: is it possible to merge the second test result report with the first, or am I stuck with the two?</p>

"681572","1","681656","","2009-03-25 13:23:29","","1","8469","<p>First, some background:</p>

<p>Our product needs to integrate with the Lotus Notes client by adding or updating a line in the NOTES.INI file.</p>

<p>We don't have a problem if we're dealing with a single-user installation of Notes (i.e. if there are multiple Windows users on the machine, they'll all use the same Notes configuration). In this case, there's a single NOTES.INI file in the Notes installation directory.</p>

<p>However, under a multi-user installation of Notes (where each Windows user has their own Notes configuration), each user has their own NOTES.INI file stored in the user's LocalAppData directory - e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Application Data\Lotus\Notes.</p>

<p>So here's the problem:
If our product is being installed on a machine with a multi-user installation of the Notes client, we need to be able to update the NOTES.INI file in the profile of each user on that machine.</p>

<p>We can do this by having a program run when users log in, which checks whether that user's NOTES.INI file has been updated yet and if not, updates it. However, the uninstall process for our application needs to be able to reverse these modifications for all users on the machine.</p>

<p>Hence the question: assuming our code is running with local admin rights, is there some way that we can iterate through each user's profile and find their LocalAppData directory so we can make the necessary changes?</p>

<p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated :-)</p>

<p>EDIT 2009-03-25 16:52 GMT:<br>
Looks like I have a possible approach (thanks Martin C):</p>

<pre>
    For each subkey of <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</b>:
      If it's a ""real"" user (determined somehow):
        Remember the subkey name - that's the user's SID
        Read the ProfileImagePath value
        If the user's Registry hive is not already loaded (i.e. there is no subkey of <b>HKEY_USERS</b> with the appropriate SID):
          Enable the <b>SE_BACKUP_NAME</b> and <b>SE_RESTORE_NAME</b> privileges
          Load the hive from <b>ProfileImagePath\NtUser.dat</b> using RegLoadKey
        Try to find the user's LocalAppData folder using each of the following Registry keys in turn:
          <b>HKEY_USERS\&lt;SID&gt;\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</b>
          <b>HKEY_USERS\&lt;SID&gt;\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</b>
          <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</b>
          <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</b>
        Expand environment variables in the resulting path if necessary (presumably just expanding %USERPROFILE% to the ProfileImagePath we got earlier)
        Use the path to find the user's NOTES.INI file and make the appropriate changes
        If we had to load the hive:
          Unload the hive using RegUnLoadKey
</pre>

<p>I can probably get that coded up, but it seems a tiny bit fragile and there's potentially a number of ways it can go wrong.
Anyone have a more ""official"" approach?</p>

<p>drawView is called every time the screen is touched or the finger on the screen is moved and tx,ty are set to the x,y coordinates where that touch happened. </p>

<p>I've also tried using GLBuffer, when translation was pre-generated and there was only one DrawArray but gave the same performance (~4 FPS).</p>

<p>===EDIT===</p>

<p>Meanwhile I've modified this so that much smaller quads are used (sized: 34x20) and much less overlapping is done. There are ~400 quads->800 triangles spread on the whole screen. Texture size is 512x512 atlas and RGBA_8888 while the texture coordinates are in float.
The code is very ugly in terms of API efficiency: there are two MatrixMode change along with two loads and two translation then a drawarrays for a triangle strip (quad). 
Now this produces ~45 FPS.</p>

The type of VAL3 is definetly a subtype of myEnum as it has overloaded and additional methods. (the class type comes as 'myEnum$1' ) <br><br>
But how can the compiler creates a subtype enum extending myEnum as all the enums are already extending java.lang.enum ? <br></p>

<p>You'll need to use the command line argument BCP to dump the data in it's original (native) format to a binary file. Then on the other server you can bulk insert this binary data back into a table of the same strucutre.</p>

<p>here's some code.</p>

<h3>Export</h3>

<pre><code>Command Line: bcp ""geodata.dbo.GeographyData"" out ""C:\GeoData.bin"" -T -n -S &lt;servername&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>This uses a Trusted connection</li>
<li>use the bcp /? for more help for your export options if u need to be hardcore.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Importing the data</h3>

<pre><code>T-SQL: bulk insert GeographyData from 'C:\GeoData.bin' with (dataFileType='Native')
</code></pre>

<p>I learnt all this through the Spatial guru <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/isaac/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Isaac Kunen</a> and with the help of <a href=""http://sqlblog.com/blogs/kent_tegels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kent Tegels</a>, in this discussion thread <a href=""http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=4182363&amp;SiteID=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The reason for the BCP method is highlighted by Isaac in this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its worth pointing out that WKB is a
  lossy format, in that it does not
  store the SRID.  So if you extract and
  insert the WKB, you'll have to carry
  the SRID yourself.  Our internal
  binary format does store the SRID, so
  a BCP like this should be less hassle.</p>

<p>For example, if you try to delete a file which another process has opened the operating system will usually let you do it. The original process still keeps it's file-handles until it terminates - at which point the the file-system will quietly re-cycle the disk-resources. No fuss, that's the way I like it.</p>

<p>How different things are on Windows: If I try to delete a file which another process is using I get an Operating-System error. The file is untouchable until the original process releases it's lock on the file. That was great back in the single-user days of MS-DOS when any locking process was likely to be on the same computer that contained the files, however on a network it's a nightmare:</p>

<p>Consider what happens when a process hangs while writing to a shared file on a Windows file-server. Before the file can be deleted we have to locate the computer and ID the process on that computer which originally opened the file. Only then can we kill the process and delete our unwanted file. </p>

<p>What a nuisance!</p>

<p>Is there a way to make this better? What I want is for file-locking on Windows to behave a like file-locking in UNIX. I want the operating system to just let me do what I want because I'm in charge and I know what I'm doing... </p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    int intFoo;
    double doubleFoo;
    string stringFoo;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to create an accessor.  Some way to get at this data.  Obviously, I could create multiple accessors:</p>

<pre><code>public int GetIntFoo();
public double GetDoubleFoo();
public string GetStringFoo();
</code></pre>

<p>Or I could create multiple properties</p>

<pre><code>public int IntFoo { get; set; }
public double DoubleFoo { get; set; }
public string StringFoo { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>I don't that this is a very good design.  It requires the client code to be more concerned about type than it should have to be.  What's more, I really need only a single value for this class and the above would allow one of each type to be assigned at the same time.  Not good.</p>

<p>One option is to use Generics.  </p>

<pre><code>class Foo&lt;T&gt;
{
    public T TheFoo { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't create a Foo, it creates a Foo&lt;T&gt;.  A different type for each, so I can't really use them as the same type.</p>

<p>I could derive Foo&lt;T&gt; from FooBase, then treat all of them as FooBase's, but then i'm back in the problem of accessing the data.  </p>

<p>A different Generics option is to use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    string stringRepresentationOfFoo;
    public T GetFoo&lt;T&gt;() { return /* code to convert string to type */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>OF course the problem is that any kind of T could be passed, and frankly, it's a bit busy.</p>

<p>I could also just box the values and return an object, but then there is no type safety.</p>

<p>Ideally, I want to treat all Foo's the same, but I want type safety so that if there isn't a StringFoo, I can't even compile a reference to a StringFoo.</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo(""Foo"");
string sFoo = foo.Value;  // succeeds.
&amp;nbsp;
Foo foo = new Foo(0);
int iFoo = foo.Value; // succeeds
string sFoo = foo.Value; // compile error
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps this isn't even possible.. and I'll have to make some compromises, but maybe i'm missing something.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, so as daniel points out, the compile time checking of a runtime type is not practical.  </p>

<p>What is my best option for doing what I want to do here?  Namely, Treat all Foo's the same, but still have a relatively sane access mechanism?</p>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>I don't want to convert the value to different types.  I want to return the correct type for the value.  That is, if it's a double, I don't want to return an int.</p>

<p>The properties of <code>MyPresentation</code> are then data bound to various controls and I use <code>Trigger</code>s etc to change presentation dependency properties which causes business object changes in the <code>OnPropertyChanged</code> event</p>

<p>The question I have is am I using binding in the correct fashion? Normally (in Winforms) I'd have used click events etc to change my business objects (or the presentation versions of them) values but those sort of events and that sort of event handling seems superfluous now that you can use <code>Binding</code>, <code>Trigger</code>s and <code>OnPropertyChanged</code> events.</p>

<p>in order to elaborate the info contained in those files.
The function has the aim of write in just 1 line the logs that are stored in those files using 3 lines ... The function is working fine on files read from my local machine but I cannot figure out how to connect to a remote server and create these one-line logs without storing the content of each file into a string and then working with the string ... The command that I use to connect to the remote machine is :</p>

<pre><code>connection_out = Popen(['ssh', retList[0], 'cd '+retList[2]+'; cat'+fileName], stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0]
</code></pre>

<p>retList[0] and retList[2] are the user@remote and the folder name that I have to access</p>

<p>Thanks to all in advance !</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>My problem is that I have to establish an ssh connection first :</p>

<pre><code>pr1=Popen(['ssh', 'siatc@lgssp101', '*~/XYZ/AAAAA/log_archive/00/MSG_090308_162648.gz*' ], stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0]

<p>All the files that I need to open are stored in a list, fileList[], part of them are compressed (.gz) and part are just text files !! I have tried all the procedures that u showed before bot nothing worked ... I think that I mus modify the third argument of the Popen function but I cannot figure out how to do it ! Is there anyone that can help me ???</p>

<p>So far I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>DOMContentLoaded</strong> : On Mozilla, Opera 9 and newest WebKits. This involves adding a listener to the event:</p>

<p>document.addEventListener( ""DOMContentLoaded"", [init function], false );</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deferred script</strong>: On IE, you can emit a SCRIPT tag with a @defer attribute, which will reliably only load after the closing of the BODY tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polling</strong>: On other browsers, you can keep polling, but is there even a standard thing to poll for, or do you need to do different things on each browser?</p></li>

<p>So I have a GroupBox whose header is a CheckBox. We've all done something like this - typically you bind the content of the GroupBox in such a way that it's disabled when the CheckBox is unchecked.</p>

<p>However, when I run this application and click on the CheckBox, I've found that sometimes my mouse clicks are swallowed and the CheckBox's status doesn't change. If I'm right, it's when I click on the exact row of pixels that the GroupBox's top border sits on.</p>

<p>Can someone duplicate this? Why would this occur, and is there a way around it?</p>

<p>Edit: Setting the GroupBox's BorderThickness to 0 solves the problem, but obviously it removes the border, so it doesn't look like a GroupBox anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
Compute a simple 32-bit checksum over a binary blob of data by treating it as an array of 32-bit integers (we know its total length is a multiple of 4), and then summing up all values and ignoring overflow.
</blockquote>

<p>I would expect such an function to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>uint32_t compute_checksum(const char *data, size_t size)
{
    const uint32_t *udata = /* ??? */;
    uint32_t checksum = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i != size / 4; ++i)
        checksum += udata[i];
    return udata;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the question I have is, what do you consider the ""best"" way to convert <code>data</code> to <code>udata</code>?</p>

<p>C-style cast?</p>

<pre><code>udata = (const uint32_t *)data
</code></pre>

<p>C++ cast that assumes all pointers are convertible?</p>

<pre><code>udata = reinterpret_cast&lt;const uint32_t *&gt;(data)
</code></pre>

<p>C++ cast that between arbitrary pointer types using intermediate <code>void*</code>?</p>

<pre><code>udata = static_cast&lt;const uint32_t *&gt;(static_cast&lt;const void *&gt;(data))
</code></pre>

<p>Cast through a union?</p>

<pre><code>union {
    const uint32_t *udata;
    const char *cdata;
};
cdata = data;
// now use udata
</code></pre>

<p>I fully realize that this will not be a 100% portable solution, but I am only expecting to use it on a small set of platforms where I know it works (namely unaligned memory accesses and compiler assumptions on pointer aliasing).  What would you recommend?</p>

<p>I have a string value in a variable that I want to manipulate at some point in my application - so the code would essentially be string manipulation. I don't know what different manipulations will be needed so i'd like them to be configurable. </p>

<p>I don't really care what language the dynamic code is written in, whatever is easiest to implement and simple enough to write.</p>

<p>For example I might want to replace instances of '.' character with '-', or strip out all spaces, or similar. If I was doing this in sql I'd use dynamic sql, but I want to execute it in .net code, something like this: </p>

<pre><code>// Get the value to be manipulated
string s = ... // wherever s comes from

// Get the manipulation code, eg this might come from a database 
// setting that can be changed without recompiling the .net code.
string manipulation = Settings.GetSomeValue(""ManipulationSetting"");

// This is what I want to know how to do: apply some manipulation to the string.
string result = MagicDynamicEvalClass.Eval(manipulation, s);

// Now I would do stuff with the result.
</code></pre>

<p>I could possibly just use regex find/replace expressions. Since all i'm doing is string manipulation this should be sufficient provided I can write clever enough regular expressions.  eg: </p>

<pre><code>// Get the value to be manipulated
string s = ... // wherever s comes from

// Get the code to use to manipulate s, eg this might come from a database 
// setting that can be changed without recompiling the .net code.
string findRegex = Settings.GetSomeValue(""RegexPattern"");
string replaceRegex = Settings.GetSomeValue(""RegexReplace"");

// This is what I want to know how to do: apply some manipulation to the string.
string result = Regex.Replace(s, findRegex, replaceRegex);

// Now I can do stuff with the result.
</code></pre>

<p>But in some cases my manipulation requirement might exceed what's possible with regex, or I might want to apply multiple steps, eg replace '.' with '-' and also strip spaces. Perhaps I could store a list of find/replace regexes and iterate over them... but anyone have a better suggestion?</p>

<p>UPDATE - example using dynamic sql</p>

<p>I don't want a solution that requires me to know in advance what manipulations are possible, and I'm really looking for something simple. eg in sql I'd do something like this: </p>

<pre><code>declare @s nvarchar(1000)
declare @manipulation nvarchar(1000)
declare @result nvarchar(1000)

-- ... Get the values from wherever they come from

-- Execute the manipulation dynamically
EXEC sp_ExecuteSQL @stmt = @manipulation
    , @params = N'@s nvarchar(1000), @result nvarchar(1000) OUTPUT'
    , @s = @s, @result = @result OUTPUT
</code></pre>

<p>Then I could put arbitrary sql into my @manipulation, something like this 
  SET @result = REPLACE( REPLACE( @s, '.', '-'), ' ', '' )</p>

<p>Yes, this would require me to be careful about what values are allowed to be put into @manipulation, but it would give me the flexibility I need in future. </p>

<p>A similar approach would be possible in javascript I guess, using eval().</p>

<p>UPDATE - example using MSScript control from .net: </p>

<p><a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/articles/DotNetScripting.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">This</a> seems like a possible approach, although perhaps overkill for the simple case I want to deal with. It uses the Microsoft Script Control library to allow execution of arbitrary VBScript.</p>

<p>Using C# and .NET 2.0, I've been using dataSet.WriteXml(fileName, XmlWriteMode.IgnoreSchema), which by default is writing the Xml file with pretty print. The company consuming the Xml files I write suggested that writing without the pretty print will not affect them, and will significantly decrease the size of the files. With a little playing around in the System.Xml namespace, I did find a solution. However, in my searching I did not find the answer anywhere, so I thought it might be helpful to someone else in the future if I posted the question. Also, I wouldn't be surprised at all if there's a better or at least different way of accomplishing this.</p>

<p>For those that don't know (I didn't until today), Xml ""pretty print"" is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;
&lt;NewDataSet&gt;
  &lt;Foo&gt;
    &lt;Bar&gt;abc&lt;/Bar&gt;
  &lt;/Foo&gt;
&lt;/NewDataSet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Without pretty print it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;&lt;NewDataSet&gt;&lt;Foo&gt;&lt;Bar&gt;abc&lt;/Bar&gt;&lt;/Foo&gt;&lt;/NewDataSet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, the size savings was significant, 70mb files are becoming about 40mb. I'll post my solution later today if no one else has.</p>

So for instance, say I have an Entry model and an EntryVersion model:</p>

<p><strong>Entry</strong><br>
- title<br>
- slug</p>

<p><strong>EntryVersion</strong><br>
- entry (foreign key)<br>
- version_number<br>
- content</p>

<p>I want to auto-increment <code>version_number</code> with respect to the entry foreign key (so that an entry might have several versions, starting at one and moving upwards by one).  It won't be a true auto-increment, though, because it won't be unique in the database (there might be many entry versions with version_number = 1; just only one for a given Entry).</p>

<p>I know that I could roll my own admin and just handle this there, but was wondering if there were any way to have the Django admin automatically increase the version number by one whenever a new entry version is saved.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit: specific code that I used (corrected to only set version number on first save)</strong></p>

<p>Tiago's answer was right, but in the interest of future StackOverflow users with similar dilemmas, here's the specific code that I used:</p>

<pre><code>def save(self, force_insert=False, force_update=False):
    # Only modify number if creating for the first time (is default 0)
    if self.version_number == 0:
        # Grab the highest current index (if it exists)
        try:
            recent = EntryVersion.objects.filter(entry__exact=self.entry).order_by('-version_number')[0]
            self.version_number = recent.version_number + 1
        except IndexError:
            self.version_number = 1
    # Call the ""real"" save() method
    super(EntryVersion, self).save(force_insert, force_update)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>order_by</code> w/ index trick is one I gleaned from the Django documentation here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#id4"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#id4</a></p>

<p>Note that you must have <code>default=0</code> defined on your <code>version_number</code> field for this to work.</p>

<p>There may be a better way, but this seems to be working exactly the way I needed; hopefully others will also find it useful.</p>

<p>I cannot just set the src of the iframe to the word document as need a reference to the word document (objWord) to allow me to paste text into it in real time again using Vbscript to do this.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is possible but any ideas/alternatives welcome?</p>

The word doc needs to be displayed from web browser</p>

<p>At the side of the word document will be some buttons which when clicked paste text into it</p>

The project uses SQL Server as the database. We have done performance testing with some large volumes of data, results show that performance degrades when data becomes too large, say 2 million rows (timeout issues, delayed reponses, etc). At first we were using fully normailized database, but now we made it partially normalized due to performance issues (to reduce joins). First of all, is it the right decision?
Plus what are the possible solutions when data size becomes very large, as the no. of clients increase in future? </p>

<p>I would like to add further:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 million rows are entity tables, tables resolving the relations have much larger rows.</li>
<li>Performance degrades when data + no. of users increases. </li>
<li>Denormalization was done after identifying the heavily used queries.</li>
<li>We are also using some heavy amount of xml columns and xquery. Can this be the cause?</li>
<li>A bit off the topic, some folks in my project say that dynamic sql query is faster than a stored procedure approach. They have done some kind of performance testing to prove their point. I think the opposite is true. Some of the heavily used queries are dynamicaly created where as most of other queries are encapsulated in stored procedures.</li>

<p>This is only an issue with the Excel 2002/2003 XML Spreadsheet format... the native Excel  format works fine, as does the newer Excel 2007 XML format (xlsx).</p>

<p>After loading the spreadsheet, it is possible to make it work correctly by selecting the formatted range, going to the Conditional Formatting dialog, and clicking OK--but this only fixes the problem for the session.</p>

<p><strong>Test case:</strong></p>

<p>Enter the following into a new sheet:</p>

<pre><code>  A B C
1 N N N
2 x x x
3 x x x</code></pre>

<p>Create this conditional format formula on cells A1:C1 (your choice of pretty colors for the format):</p>

<pre><code>=(SUM(($A1:$C1=""N"")*($A$2:$C$2=A$3))>0)</code></pre>

<p>This is an array formula that activates for A1, B1, and C1 whenever any of them has an ""N"" and the cell in row 2 below the ""N"" is equal to the cell in row 3 of the current column. </p>

<p>(This has been simplified from a real-world business spreadsheet. Sorry for the complexity of the test case, I am trying to find an easier test case to present here.)</p>

<p>And it works... you can alter the N's or the x's in any way you want and the formatting works just fine.</p>

<p>Save this as an XML Spreadsheet. Close Excel, and re-open the file. Formatting is now broken. Now, you can only activate conditional formatting if A1 is an ""N"" and A2 is the same as A3, B3, or C3. The values of B1, B2, C1, and C2 have no effect on the formatting.</p>

<p>Now, select A1:C1 and look at the conditional formatting formula. Exactly the same as before. Hit OK. Conditional formatting starts working again, and will work during the entire session the file is open.</p>

<p><strong>Workarounds considered:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Providing the file in native (BIFF) Excel format. Not an option, these spreadsheets are generated on the fly by a web server and this is only one of dozens of types of workbooks generated dynamically by our system.</p></li>
<li><p>Providing the file in the Excel 2007 native XML format (xlsx). Not an option, current user base does not have Office 2007 or the compatibility plug-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking users to select the range, enter the Conditional Formatting dialog, and hitting ok. Not an option in this case, unsophisticated users.</p></li>
<li><p>Asking users to open the XML spreadsheet, save as native XLS, close, and re-open the XLS file. <strong>This does not work!</strong> Formatting remains broken in the native XLS format if it was loaded broken from an XML file. If (3) above is performed before saving, the XLS file will work properly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I ended up rewriting the conditional formatting to not use array formulas. So I guess this is ""answered"" to some degree, but it's still an undocumented, if obscure, bug in Excel 2002/2003's handling of XML files.</strong></p>

<p>We observe that when running 32-bit processes,
the performance of memcpy is on the order of
1.2GByte/s; however memcpy in a 64-bit process
achieves about 2.2GByte/s (or 2.4GByte/s

initial reaction might be to just explain this

the process) demonstrates similar upper limits on
the copy bandwidth it achieves.</p>

<p>My question is, what's this difference actually

"277817","1","284462","","2008-11-10 13:05:36","","9","8532","<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I have two wrappers around Microsoft Office, one for 2003 and one for 2007. Since having two versions of Microsoft Office running side by side is ""not officially possible"" nor recommended by Microsoft, we have two boxes, one with Office 2003 and the other with Office 2007. We compile the wrappers separately. The DLLs are included in our solution, each box has the <em>same</em> checkout but with either Office 2003 or 2007 ""unloaded"" so it doesn't attempt to compile that particular DLL. Failure to do that will throw errors on compilation due to the Office COM DLLs not available. </p>

<p>We use .NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2008.</p>

<h2>Facts</h2>

<p>Since Microsoft mysteriously changed the Office 2003 API in 2007, renaming and changing some methods (<em>sigh</em>) thus making them not backwards compatible, we <em>need</em> the two wrappers.
We have each build machine with the solution and one Office DLL activated. E.g.: the machine with Office 2003 has the ""Office 2007"" DLL unloaded, therefore not compiling it. The other box is the same idea but the other way around. All this because we can't have 2 different Office in the same box for programming purposes. (you could technically have two Office together according to Microsoft) but <em>not</em> for programming and not without some issues.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>When we change the Application Version (from 1.5.0.1 to 1.5.0.2 for example) we need to recompile the DLL to match the new version of the application, this is automatically done, because the Office wrapper is included in the solution. Since the wrappers are contained in the solution, those inherit the APP Version, but we have to do it twice and then ""copy"" the other DLL to the machine that creates the installer. (A Pain…)</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is it possible to compile a DLL that will work with <em>any</em> version of the application, despite being ""older""? I've read something about manifests but I have never had to interact with those. Any pointers will be appreciated.</p>

<p>The secret reason for this is that we haven't changed our wrappers in ""ages"" and neither did Microsoft with their ancient APIs, yet we are recompiling the DLL to match the app version on <em>every</em> release we make. I'd like to automate this process instead of having to rely on <em>two</em> machines.</p>

<p>I can't remove the DLL from the project (neither of them) because there are dependencies. </p>

<p>I could create a third ""master wrapper"" but haven't thought about it yet. </p>

<p>Any ideas? Anyone else with the same requirement? </p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>Clarifying:</p>

<p>I have 1 solution with N projects. </p>

<p>""Application"" + Office11Wrapper.dll + Office12Wrapper.dll.</p>

<p>Both ""wrappers"" use dependencies for application + other libraries in the solution (datalayer, businesslayer, framework, etc.)</p>

<p>Each wrapper has references for the respective Office package (2003 and 2007). </p>

<p>If I compile and don't have office 12 installed, I get errors from Office12Wrapper.dll not finding the Office 2007 libraries.
So what I have are two building machines, one with Office 2003, one with Office 2007. After a full SVN update + compile on each machine, we simply use office12.dll in the ""installer"" to have the wrapper compiled against the ""same code, same version"".</p>

<p>Note: The Office 2007 Build Machine, has the Wrapper for Office 2003 ""unloaded"" and viceversa.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>How can I get the wrap div to always fill the cell, so that the management area sits at the bottom of the cell?  And yes, the data that I am putting in the table is (in my mind) tabular, so I would like to use a table here.  As a last resort, I may turn to an ugly nested div solution, but since a table is semantically correct here I'd like to use one if possible.  Note that the background colors are simply to show the relative sizes of the elements - I don't care about background for my layout.  Also note that I'd like the cells to have a flexible height, so that they only expand enough to fit their content.</p>

<p>I've put a label on one of the items so that I can reference the specific step later on.  The problem is that when the reference is rendered, it's rendered using a letter, not the number of the sub item.</p>

/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""uiElement""&gt;The control that is being updated.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""updater""&gt;The method that updates uiElement.&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""forceSynchronous""&gt;True to force synchronous execution of 
/// updater.  False to allow asynchronous execution if the call is marshalled
/// from a non-GUI thread.  If the method is called on the GUI thread,
/// execution is always synchronous.&lt;/param&gt;
public static void SafeInvoke(this Control uiElement, Action updater, bool forceSynchronous)
{
    if (uiElement == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(""uiElement"");
    }

    if (uiElement.InvokeRequired)
    {
        if (forceSynchronous)
        {
            uiElement.Invoke((Action)delegate { SafeInvoke(uiElement, updater, forceSynchronous); });
        }
        else
        {
            uiElement.BeginInvoke((Action)delegate { SafeInvoke(uiElement, updater, forceSynchronous); });
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (!uiElement.IsHandleCreated)
        {
            // Do nothing if the handle isn't created already.  The user's responsible
            // for ensuring that the handle they give us exists.

            throw new ObjectDisposedException(""Control is already disposed."");

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre><code>this.lblTimeDisplay.SafeInvoke(() =&gt; this.lblTimeDisplay.Text = this.task.Duration.ToString(), false);
</code></pre>

<p>I like how I can leverage closures to read, also, though forceSynchronous needs to be true in that case:</p>

<pre><code>string taskName = string.Empty;
this.txtTaskName.SafeInvoke(() =&gt; taskName = this.txtTaskName.Text, true);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't question the usefulness of this method for fixing up illegal calls in legacy code, but what about new code?  </p>

<p>Is it good design to use this method to update UI in a piece of new software when you may not know what thread is attempting to update the ui, or should new Winforms code generally contain a specific, dedicated method with the appropriate <code>Invoke()</code>-related plumbing for all such UI updates?  (I'll try to use the other appropriate background processing techniques first, of course, e.g. BackgroundWorker.)</p>

<p>Interestingly this won't work for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.toolstripitem.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ToolStripItems</a>.  I just recently discovered that they derive directly from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.component.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Component</a> instead of from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Control</a>.  Instead, the containing <code>ToolStrip</code>'s invoke should be used.</p>

<h2>Followup to comments:</h2>

<p>Some comments suggest that:</p>

<pre><code>if (uiElement.InvokeRequired)
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>if (uiElement.InvokeRequired &amp;&amp; uiElement.IsHandleCreated)
</code></pre>

<p>Consider the following <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.invokerequired.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">msdn documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means that InvokeRequired can
  <strong>return false</strong> if Invoke is not required
  (the call occurs on the same thread),
  or <strong>if the control was created on a
  different thread but the control's
  handle has not yet been created.</strong></p>
  
  <p>In the case where the control's handle
  has not yet been created, you should
  not simply call properties, methods,
  or events on the control. This might
  cause the control's handle to be
  created on the background thread,
  isolating the control on a thread
  without a message pump and making the
  application unstable.</p>
  
  <p><strong>You can protect against this case by
  also checking the value of
  IsHandleCreated when InvokeRequired
  returns false on a background thread.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the control was created on a different thread but the control's handle has not yet been created, <code>InvokeRequired</code> returns false.  This means that if <code>InvokeRequired</code> returns <code>true</code>, <code>IsHandleCreated</code> will always be true.  Testing it again is redundant and incorrect.</p>

Are event handlers running asynchronously, in which case I need synchronized access to shared data, or should I instead be looking for bugs in the library code for cancelling pop-ups?</p>

<ul>
<li>The library in question is <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SIMILE Timeline</a> and its Ajax library;</li>

"299761","1","300753","","2008-11-18 18:59:22","","17","8548","<p>I'm starting to use CUDA at the moment and have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed with the C API. I understand the reasons for choosing C but had the language been based on C++ instead, several aspects would have been a lot simpler, e.g. device memory allocation (via <code>cudaMalloc</code>).</p>

<p>My plan was to do this myself, using overloaded <code>operator new</code> with placement <code>new</code> and RAII (two alternatives). I'm wondering if there are any caveats that I haven't noticed so far. The code <em>seems</em> to work but I'm still wondering about potential memory leaks.</p>

<p>The usage of the <strong>RAII</strong> code would be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CudaArray&lt;float&gt; device_data(SIZE);
// Use `device_data` as if it were a raw pointer.
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps a class is overkill in this context (especially since you'd still have to use <code>cudaMemcpy</code>, the class only encapsulating RAII) so the other approach would be <strong>placement <code>new</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>float* device_data = new (cudaDevice) float[SIZE];
// Use `device_data` …
operator delete [](device_data, cudaDevice);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>cudaDevice</code> merely acts as a tag to trigger the overload. However, since in normal placement <code>new</code> this would indicate the placement, I find the syntax oddly consistent and perhaps even preferable to using a class.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate criticism of every kind. Does somebody perhaps know if something in this direction is planned for the next version of CUDA (which, as I've heard, will improve its C++ support, whatever they mean by that).</p>

<p>So, my question is actually threefold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is my placement <code>new</code> overload semantically correct? Does it leak memory?</li>
<li>Does anybody have information about future CUDA developments that go in this general direction (let's face it: C interfaces in C++ s*ck)?</li>
<li>How can I take this further in a consistent manner (there are other APIs to consider, e.g. there's not only device memory but also a constant memory store and texture memory)? </li>
</ol>

I soon realized that a data element has to be bound to a dataset (only one of them.) </p>

<p>I found a <a href=""http://eclipsezone.net/eclipse/forums/m92006973.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similar question</a> in the BIRT mailing list which helped me get to a solution - I can bind an individual data element to a different dataset, but it can still access the elements of its container.  I can send a parameters to the dataset that the element is bound to (e.g. ""ACT"" in the example I mentioned above).</p>

<p>Eventually however, I came to a place where I needed to use data from three different tables.  I am stuck here, and I'm assuming that there is a way to do this through the scripting abilities, but I have yet to see in the documentation a way to extract data from a data set - everything I have dealt with so far is associated with binding a report element to a dataset.</p>

<p>What about other options, like just sending the data as method parameters?  (Would this be easiest in asces wher there is less data to send?)</p>

<p>What about a static class that just holds data, that can be referenced by other objects (a kind of global asembly data storage class)?  (Does this break encapsulation too much?)</p>

<p>What about a single generic DTO used for every transfer?  It may be a bit more trouble to use, but reduces the number of classes needed to work with (reduces object clutter).</p>

<p>Based on Kevin Crowell's answer...
So I guess you would have a rendering distance that would apply to objects and NPC's, and you would ""SELECT"" the objects and NPC's within the given range.  However, what type of data store would you use in order to get these objects?</p>

<p>In other words, you would you have a gigantic array of every object in the game, and constantly update a smaller list that holds the visible objects to render?</p>

<p>Also, per Chaos' answer...
Would would happen if you eventually touched every object in the game?  Would your save game get bigger and bigger?  In the case of Fallout 3, I'm pretty sure there aren't ""stages"", where the past data could just be dropped.  Everything is persisted when you leave/return to a location.

<p>I'm not interested in serializing complex class hierarchies, but more of sending structures with a few simple members such as number, strings and data vectors. The data vectors can often be many megabytes large.
I'm worried that text/xml-based ways of doing it is too slow and I really don't want to write this myself since problems like string encoding and number endianess can make it way more complicated than it looks on the surface.</p>

<p>I've been looking a bit at protocol buffers and boost.serialize. According to the documents protocol buffers seems to care much about performance.
Boost seems somewhat more lightweight in the sense that you don't have an external language for specifying the data format which I find quite convenient for this particular project.</p>

<p>So my question comes down to this: does anyone know if the boost serialization is fast for the typical use case I described above?</p>

<p>Also if there are other libraries that might be right for this, I'd be happy to hear about them.</p>

  <p>In particular, do not overload

<p>I'm a little fuzzy on what such a functor would look like, but my main question is, <em>why</em> would you want to write your own functors for this?

Let me describe a problem. In big software project it's always a big classes like 'core' or 'ui' that tends to have a lot of methods and are intended as a mediators between smaller classes. For example, if user clicks a button on some window, this window's class sends a message to 'ui' class. This 'ui' class catches this message and acts accordingly by doing something with application user interface ( via calling method of one of it's member objects ) or by posting message to application 'core' if it's something like 'exit application' or 'start network connection'.</p>

<p>Such objects is very hard to break apart since they are a mere mediators between a lots of small application objects. But having a classes in application with hundreds and thousands of methods is not very handy, event if such methods are trivial task delegation from one object to another. C# solves such problem by allowing to break class implementation into multiple source files: you can divide god object any way you choose, and it will work.</p>

<p>Any practices by dividing such objects in Java?</p>

<p>We have two projects that we build into SWCs and these components contain resource bundles. One SWC requires the other SWC. We have one project that we build into our application (the SWF) which uses both SWCs.</p>

<p>When I build the SWCs, I get no complaints about resource bundles not being found, and when I open the SWCs in winzip, I can see the bundles (in /locale/EN_US, for example)</p>

<p>When I build the SWF, however, I get complaints about not being able to find the resource bundles in the two swc's, but no complaints about not being able to find any other resource bundles (like the flex framework ones).

<p>This appears to complete half of the battle. I can see <code>MyVectorConverter</code> getting called into, but something is amiss. It is called to see if it knows how to convert to string, then it is called to convert to string. However, it is never queried to see if it can convert FROM string nor to actually do the conversion. Furthermore, right after an edit in the textbox, the old value is immediately replaced (another CanConvertTo and ConvertTo sequence, restoring the old value). The end result is that the newly typed entry in the text box is reverted immediately after it is applied. </p>

<p>I feel as if there is just something simple missing. Is there? Is this entire project/approach doomed to failure? Does anyone else attempt such madness? How does one bi-directionally bind a custom, multipart type to a string-based control?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Bizarrely, all that is needed is for the ""formatting"" to be enabled on the Binding object. (thanks, Jon Skeet):</p>

<pre><code>textBox.DataBindings.Add(""Text"", this, ""MyVectorProperty""); //FAILS
textBox.DataBindings.Add(""Text"", this, ""MyVectorProperty"", true); //WORKS!
</code></pre>

<p>Oddly, all that my MSDN mentions about this parameter (formattingEnabled) is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""true to format the displayed data; otherwise, false"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It mentions nothing about it being a requirement for the data to come back from the control (under these conditions).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>The div in questions contains two div's, one with one line of text in <code>font-size: 16px;</code>, and a div with a height of 367px.</p>

<p><strong>Another edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Okay, so I figured out what's causing this. The second div that the main div contains, contains one image, and a div that's floating over the right of that image, using <code>position: relative; top: -335px;</code>. Internet Explorer keeps the space where this element would have been blank. Any way around that?</p>

<p><strong>Final edit</strong>:</p>

<p>Solved it! I wrapped the contents of the floating div with <code>position: relative</code> in a second div with <code>position: absolute</code>, that gets rid of the whitespace under the main image :) Final HTML looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""overview""&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Some text&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=""someImage.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""float: right; position: relative; top: -335px;""&gt;
      &lt;div style=""position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; background-color: white; width: 365px;""&gt;
        Some floating contents
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>We have OSGi bundles which depend on other OSGi bundles. I'd really hate to hardcode build order in a custom ANT build. We've done this is the past and it's pretty horrible.

I'd like to setup my own build.xml to build each, BUT there are dependencies and build order issues. These issues are driven by the Manifest files (which describe OSGi imports). For example, PluginC depends on PluginB which depends on PluginA. They must be built in the correct order. I realize that I can manually control the build order, I'm looking for a tool to help automate the build order dependency management.</p>

My group has inherited some SQL server DTS packages that do daily loads and updates of large amounts of data.  Currently it is running in SQL Server 2000, but will soon be upgraded to SQL Server 2005 or 2008.  The mass updates are running too slowly.  </p>

<p>One thing I noticed about the code is that some large updates are done in procedural code in loops, so that each statement only updates a small portion of the table in a single transaction.  Is this a sound method to do updates in SQL server?  Locking of concurrent sessions should not be an issue because user access to tables is disabled while the bulk loading takes place.  I've googled around some, and found some articles suggesting that doing it this way conserves resources, and that resources are released each time an update commits, leading to greater efficiency.  In Oracle this is generally a bad approach, and I've used single transactions for very large updates with success in Oracle.  Frequent commits slow the process down and use more resources in Oracle.</p>

<p>My question is, for mass updates in SQL Server, is it generally a good practice to use procedural code, and commit many SQL statements, or to use one big statement to do the whole update?</p>

I want to make sure that the height of the screen isn't less than what I have now, in actual inches, so that the 1200 I get will be the same as the 1200 I have now, and it will just be like adding an extra 320px to the side of my existing monitor.</p>

<p>Most of the monitors I have looked at include the HxWxD, but it's for the whole thing, including sides, stand, etc.  For the life of me, I can't seem to find an actual measure of screen height and width, other than diagonal, which could be anything, depending on the diagonal angle.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have experience with the Dell 24"" 248WFP or the Soyo Pearl 26"", or have any idea on a resource that would show how TALL the screen is or square inches?</strong></p>

<p>At this point, I'd be happy if someone could just measure their screen height with a ruler for me =o)</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Seriously?  We're closing questions now because my monitor, on which I do all of my programming, which is literally the window into the world in which I work, doing my programming, isn't programming related? </p>

<p>Who here thinks that your programming tools have nothing to do with programming?  Anyone want to try coding on the 6"" monitors they have at the supermarket checkout stand?</p>

<p>This code does work and creates 3 children from same parent. However, it seems like that's because after each child process was created, it was terminated immediately. So it won't fork more grandchild process in the next round of for loop. But I need to keep these child processes running for sometime and they need to communicate with the parents. </p>

<p>Is it possible to have user authentication without Session State?</p>

<p>The specific user-authentication examples we're looking for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>User goes to website unauthenticated</li>

<p>Can this be done securely, so the cookie can not be easily spoofed?</p>

<p>Well I'm trying to write a script to copy my sql server db to a sqlite file, which gets downloaded to an air app, which then syncs the data to another sqlite file. I'm having a ton of trouble with dates. If I select a date in air and try to insert it, it fails because it's not in the right format... even if it was a valid date to begin with. I figured I'd try to experiment with the unix time since that's the only thing thats worked so far. I am considering just leaving them as varchar because I don't sort by them anyway.</p>

The phone's internal camera is very good (4 megapixels) but in j2me I only seem to be able to get a maximum of 1360x1020 image out.  I drew largely from this example <a href=""http://developers.sun.com/mobility/midp/articles/picture/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://developers.sun.com/mobility/midp/articles/picture/</a></p>

<p>What I did was start with 640x480 and increase the width and height by 80 and 60, respectively until it failed.  The line of code is:</p>

<p>jpg = mVideoControl.getSnapshot(""encoding=jpeg&amp;quality=100&amp;width="" + width + ""&amp;height="" + height);</p>

<p>So the two issues are:
 1.  The phone throws an exception when getting an image larger than 1360x1020.
 2.  The higher resolution images appear to be just smoothed versions of the smaller ones. E.g. When I take a 640x480 image and increase it in photoshop I can't tell the difference between this and one that's supposedly 1360x1020.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of j2me on the phone?  If so does anyone know of a way to get a higher resolution from within a j2me application and/or how to access the native camera from within another application?</p>

<p>My problem is that the richer you make an application, the quicker your client side gets out of control. Consider this situation...</p>

<pre><code>//Let's start some jQuery

        //okay let's add an event for when a field changes
        $(""&lt;input/&gt;"").change(function() {

            //okay something changed, let's update the server
            $.ajax({
                success:function(data) {

                    //Okay - no problem from the server... let's update
                    //the bindings on our input fields
                    $.each(container.children(), function(j,w) {

                        //YIKES!! We're deep in here now!!
                        $(w).unbind().change(function() {

                            //Then insanity starts...

                        }); // end some function

                    }); //end some loop

                } // what was this again?

            }); //ending something... not sure anymore

        }).appendTo(container); //input added to the page... logic WAY split apart

    }; //the first loop - whew! almost out!

});  //The start of the code!!

<p>Now this situation isn't too far from impossible. I'm not saying this is the right way to do it, but it's not uncommon to find yourself several levels down into a jQuery command and starting to wonder how much more logic can add before the screen begins to melt.</p>

The expand method does get me the data I am interested in, but it requires me to know all of the sub-objects that I am going to be working with in advance.  My absolute preference would be that those sub-objects would be lazy loaded for me when I access them, but this doesn't look to be an option (I could add this lazy loading to the get on that sub-object property, but it gets wiped out when I do an update of the data service reference).</p>

<p>===== Example Code using Member that has a MailingAddress =====</p>

<p>Works:    </p>

<pre><code>var me = (from m in ctx.Member.Expand(""MailingAddress"")

          select m).First();

<p>Would Prefer (would really like if this then went and loaded the MailingAddress)</p>

          select m).First();
MessageBox.Show(me.MailingAddress.Street);

<p>Or at least (note: something similar to this, with MailingAddressReference, works on the server side if I do so as LINQ to Entities in a Service Operation)</p>

<pre><code>var me = (from m in ctx.Member

<p>Has anyone done this? Please comment on any capabilities, limitations, considerations about such an undertaking. Thanks!</p>

<p>We've got a simple asynchronous socket server written in C# that accepts connections from an ASP.NET web application, is sent a message, performs some processing (usually against a DB but other systems too) and then sends a response back to the client. The client is in charge of closing the connection.</p>

<p>We've been having issues where if the system is under heavy load over a long period of time (days usually), CLOSE_WAIT sockets build up on the server box (netstat -a) to an extent that the process will not accept any further connections. At that point we have to bounce the process and off it runs again.</p>

<p>We've tried running some load tests of our ASP.NET application to attempt to replicate the problem (because inferring some issue from the code wasn't possible). We think we've managed this and ended up with a WireShark <a href=""http://drop.io/close_wait3793"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">packet trace</a> of the issue manifesting itself as a SocketException in the socket server's logs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host
  at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.BeginSend(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 size, SocketFlags socketFlags, AsyncCallback callback, Object state)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried to reproduce the issue from the packet trace as a single threaded process directly talking to the socket server (using the same code the ASP.NET app does) and am unable. </p>

<p>Has anybody got any suggestions of next things to try, check for or obvious things we may be doing wrong?</p>

<p>Obviously one of the huge benefits of unit testing (and TDD) is the way it leads to (forces?) a much cleaner design, and it seems to me that the introduction of PowerMock may detract from that.  I would see this mostly manifesting itself as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going back to initialising collaborators rather than injecting them</li>
<li>Using statics rather than making the method be owned by a collaborator</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to this, something doesn't quite sit right with me about my code being bytecode manipulated for the test.  I can't really give a concrete reason for this, just that it makes me feel a little uneasy as it's just for the test and not for production.</p>

<p>At my current gig we're really pushing for the unit tests as a way for people to improve their coding practices and it feels like introducing PowerMock into the equation may let people skip that step somewhat and so I'm loathe to start using it.  Having said that, I can really see where making use of it can cut down on the amount of refactoring that needs to be done to <em>start</em> testing a class.</p>

<p>I guess my question is, what are peoples experiences of using PowerMock (or any other similar library) for these features, would you make use of them and how much overall do you want your tests influencing your design?</p>

Of course, there are no windows in such applications and PostMessage needs a window handle parameter to send a message. </p>

<p>Therefore, I created a window handle using the AllocateHWnd(MyMethod: TWndMethod) function and passed, as the 'MyMethod' parameter, a procedure I want to be called when a message is received. If it was a windowed application, PostMessage() called using the handle returned by the AllocateHWnd method would certainly send a message that would then be received by the 'MyMethod' procedure.</p>

<p>The situation, however, is different in my service applications. I do not understand why, but in one of them posting messages this way works fine, whereas in the second one it does not (the messages are not received at all). Only when the service is being stopped do I notice that two messages are received by 'MyMethod': WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY. The messages I send using PostMessage are never received by this procedure. On the other hand, the first service always receives all messages I send.</p>

<p>Could you please give me a clue that would help me find the reason of the second service not receiving my messages? I do not know in what way they can differ. I checked the settings of the services and they seem to be identical. Why then one of them works fine and the second one does not (as far as sending messages is concerned)?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>To anyone familiar with basic CSS and jQuery, I'm trying to add a simple animation to my tooltips. The problem is the triggering of such an animation. It seems that when the animation happens, if the user moves their mouse over the tooltip, the animation will go into a loop of showing and hiding until the user moves the mouse away. This is an undesired effect, as I want the animation to go away just once, when the mouse moves out of the <em>parent</em> div. I've positioned my CSS so that the tooltip appears away from the parent div, but regardless the actions should be triggering only on the parent, and not any of its children.</p>

<p>So basically, how would I go about achieving this? I want my hover/out state on my parent element to trigger a function (an animation) on the children of that parent, without the hover/out states of the children doing anything. It seems that the normal method of onMouseOver and onMouseOut is triggering even for the children of the parent that the method belongs to, which is causing some rather undesirable effects.</p>

<p>Note that I'm new to jQuery (although its amazing so far, I want to coat my site in its goodness if I can) and if there is a better way to achieve the hover/out states using jQuery I probably don't know about them. ^_^</p>

<p>Using this configuration of <code>JaxRpcPortProxyFactoryBean</code>, invoking the Service returns the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>org.springframework.remoting.RemoteProxyFailureException: Invalid JAX-RPC call configuration; nested exception is operation style: ""rpc"" not supported</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never fully understood the difference between RPC and document-style web services; however, I believe this web service is using RPC-style - so this exception confuses me.</p>

<p>Second, I'm confused on which properties I should be setting with <code>JaxRpcPortProxyFactoryBean</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I set the <code>wsdlDocumentUrl</code> property, I end up getting a HTTP 401 error as this web service sits behind HTTP Basic Authentication, and it seems Spring does not use the username/password properties when fetching the WSDL. </li>
<li>If I specify a <code>PortInterface</code> property (with a value of <code>CompanyWebServiceInterfacePort</code>), then I get a different Exception stating: 

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed to initialize service for JAX-RPC port [{<a href=""http://www.company.com/wdsl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.company.com/wdsl</a>}CompanyWebServiceInterfacePort]; nested exception is WSDL data missing, this operation is not available  </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, it's telling me that the WSDL is missing - which I can't set since Spring won't use the username/password to fetch it from the server!</p>

<p>I'm not sure if any of this makes any sense, but in essence what I'm unsure of is:</p>

<ol>
<li>For a JAX-RPC service, do I need to set the PortInterface property? Is this the path I should be going down?</li>
<li>Similiarly, does Spring need me to set the <code>wsdlDocumentUrl</code> property? If so, is there any way I can tell Spring which WSDL and get around the authentication problem?</li>
</ol>

In order to reduce hits to the database, I'm caching a lot of information using static variables. For example, a list of users is kept in memory in a static class. The class reads in all the information from the database on startup, and will update the database whenever changes are made, but it never needs to read from the datebase.</p>

<p>The class pings other webservers (if they exist) with updated information at the same time as a write to the database. The pinging mechanism is a Windows service to which the cache object registers using a random available port. It is used for other things as well.</p>

<p>The amount of data isn't all that great. At the moment I'm using it just to cache the users (password hashes, permissions, name, email etc.) It just saves a pile of calls being made to the database.</p>

<p>I'm using LINQ2SQL in a set of integration tests. I'm only using LINQ to verify changes in the database, so I want it to act like a simple data access layer rather than a full ORM. To do this,I set set the data context's ObjectTrackingEnabled property to false to prevent LINQ from caching data. This works fine, except that it breaks associations between entities.</p>

<p>For instance, assume two tables WIDGET and CATEGORY, with a FK relationship between them. With object tracking enabled, <em>widgetInstance.CATEGORY</em> is correctly lazy-loaded. With object tracking disabled, nothing is lazy loaded and the CATEGORY property is always null.</p>

Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in. </p>

<p>Here is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with 50 dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.</p>

<p>Edit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have 4 links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.</p>

<p>Edit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.</p>

<p>I'm using the AuthorizeAttributeFilter provided in MVC preview 4. This is returning an HttpUnauthorizedResult. This result is correctly setting the statusCode to 401.

I want to bypass this interception for certain urls.</p>

<p>My understanding of the internals of the mp3 format is minimal. Ideally, I am looking for a library that would abstract those details away. I would prefer to use Python (but could be convinced otherwise).</p>

<p>I would like to modify a set of mp3 files in a fairly simple way. I am not so much interested in the ID3 tags but in the audio itself. I want to be able to delete sections (e.g. drop 10 seconds from the 3rd minute), and insert sections (e.g. add credits to the end.)</p>

<p>My understanding is that the mp3 format is lossy, and so decoding it to (for example) PCM format, making the modifications, and then encoding it again to MP3 will lower the audio quality. (I would love to hear that I am wrong.)</p>

<p>I <em>conjecture</em> that if I stay in mp3 format, there will be some sort of minimum frame or packet-size to deal with, so the granularity of the operations may be coarser. I can live with that, as long as I get an accuracy of within a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>I have looked at <a href=""http://pymedia.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyMedia</a>, but it requires me to migrate to PCM to process the data.

I have seen several other libraries that only deal with the ID3 tags.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I've set up an AuditInterceptor in order to do automatic auditing on entities that implement my IAuditable interface which is used as follows:</p>

<p>public class AuditInterceptor : EmptyInterceptor
{
    public override bool OnSave(object entity, object id, object[] state, string[] propertyNames, IType[] types)
    {
        var auditable = entity as IAuditable;</p>

<pre><code>    if (auditable == null)
        return false;

    var now = DateTime.Now;
    auditable.CreateDate = now;
    auditable.ModifiedDate = now;

    return true;
}

public override bool OnFlushDirty(object entity, object id, object[] currentState,
    object[] previousState, string[] propertyNames, IType[] types)
{
    var auditable = entity as IAuditable;

    if (auditable == null)
        return false;

    auditable.ModifiedDate = DateTime.Now;

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The two fields are both not nullable in the database, POCO, and mapping file. However, on Save, while the interceptor is being called (can step through it and see the applicable fields being set to DateTime.Now), there's still an SqlDateTime exception being thrown:</p>

<p>SqlDateTime overflow. Must be between 1/1/1753 12:00:00 AM and 12/31/9999 11:59:59 PM</p>

<p>I've seen this before where there's been a mismatch somewhere (mapping file, database, POCO) where the DateTime is specified null in some and not in others. However, I've checked and it's all good on that front. I can manually set the values before SaveOrUpdate(entity) and it inserts/saves without problems. Without manually setting them, It's acting as if the interceptor is being missed altogether (even though I know it's not) and the two DateTime properties are never set (and therefore are treated as DateTime.MinValue: 01/01/0001...) and therefore out of range. But when stepping through, the values are properly set to DateTime.Now. </p>

<p>What is happening? For what it's worth, I had actually set up an event listener previously as well and it resulted in the same issue. </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Now for a dumb question that must have been answered out there somewhere, but I can't find it: As part of dealing with the above issue, I quickly checked to see whether making DateTime nullable throughout, but I know one of the breaking changes with NHibernate 2.* is that the NHibernate.Nullables are no longer supported. Therefore, what do you use in your mapping file to map the nullable DateTime? type? For i.e.:</li>
</ol>

<p>Understandably doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""CreateDate"" column=""CreateDate"" type=""DateTime?"" not-null=""false"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And no longer supported:        </p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""ModifiedDate"" column=""ModifiedDate"" type=""Nullables.NHibernate.NullableDateTimeType, Nullables.NHibernate"" not-null=""false""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any pointers would be much appreciated!</p>

I know that string literals are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_intern_pool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interned</a> so that different strings with the same value refer to the same object. I also know that a string can be interned at runtime:</p>

<pre><code>string now = DateTime.Now.ToString().Intern(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously a string that is interned at runtime resides on the heap but I had assumed that a literal is placed in the program's data segment (and said so in my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/372354/string-immutability#372380"">answer</a> to said  question). However I don't remember seeing this anywhere. I assume this is the case since it's how I would do it and the fact that the <code>ldstr</code> IL instruction is used to get literals and no allocation seems to take place seems to back me up.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, where do string literals reside? Is it on the heap, the data segment or some-place I haven't thought of?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If string literals <em>do</em> reside on the heap, when are they allocated? </p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Path=Problem}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm manually setting the <code>Problem</code> property to a value in the constructor of the object but it doesn't update the <code>TextBlock</code> accordingly . . . any ideas? I've tried <code>Mode=""OneWay""</code> and <code>Mode=""TwoWay""</code> on the binding and it still doesn't work.</p>

<p>I thought this was supposed to work automatically? Or am i fundamentally getting something wrong?</p>

<p>I know I can do:  </p>

<p>But the problem with this approach is that all the output is written to the log file, but I can't see how things are running in the mean time (so I can stop the process if anything dodgy is happening).</p>

<p>Just to pre-empt other possible questions, I can't change all the print's to a log statement as there are far too many of them and I'd rather not change anything in the code lest I be blamed for something going fubar. Plus there's the lack of time aspect as well. I also have to run this on a windows machine.</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the answers guys, in the end I went with the browser method because that was the easiest and quickest to set up, although I am convinced there is an actual answer to this problem somewhere.</p>

<p>I want to programatically create an XML document with namespaces and schemas.  Something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;myroot 
    xmlns=""http://www.someurl.com/ns/myroot"" 
    xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" 
    xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.someurl.com/ns/myroot http://www.someurl.com/xml/schemas/myschema.xsd""&gt;

    &lt;sometag&gt;somecontent&lt;/sometag&gt;

&lt;/myroot&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the rather splendid new LINQ stuff (which is new to me), and was hoping to do the above using an XElement.</p>

<p>I've got a ToXElement() method on my object:</p>

<pre><code>  public XElement ToXElement()
  {
     XNamespace xnsp = ""http://www.someurl.com/ns/myroot"";

     XElement xe = new XElement(
        xnsp + ""myroot"",
           new XElement(xnsp + ""sometag"", ""somecontent"")
        );

     return xe;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me the namespace correctly, thus:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;myroot xmlns=""http://www.someurl.com/ns/myroot""&gt;
   &lt;sometag&gt;somecontent&lt;/sometag&gt;
&lt;/myroot&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My question: how can I add the schema xmlns:xsi and xsi:schemaLocation attributes?</p>

<p>(BTW I can't use simple XAtttributes as I get an error for using the colon "":"" in an attribute name...)</p>

<p>Or do I need to use an XDocument or some other LINQ class?</p>

When working on a bigger change, a feature branch is used, regularly synced with trunk, and later reintegrated back into trunk (using 1.5 now). Pretty standard stuff.</p>

<p>What I am wondering is whether such a feature branch, once finished and merged should be kept around, or deleted. The subversion book occasionally seems to suggest that it is common to delete them, but I've also seen a bunch of Open Source projects which do keep the branches.</p>

<p>I am also somewhat concerned about how deleting a branch will make it harder to keep track of which branches existed, especially when potentially duplicate names enter the scenario (say we search-refactor twice), their commit histories disappearing somewhere in the depth of the repository etc. </p>

<p>On the other hand, branches are used quite a lot, especially with 1.5 now, and I do like the thought of not having to poke through a large list of inactive branches to find the ones I am currently working on.</p>

<p>It's important that the broker picks a server that has low latency so with the data we have I think proximity is our only available criteria.</p>

C) If I launch a new instance of Internet Explorer and load the same page it starts a new Session.   </p>

<p>I'm confused by step C. I'm expecting it to be the same session based on my remote IP.<br>
What is IIS / ASP.NET doing to decide that this is a new session?
Is it looking at my remote port that the new instance of IE is using? When you kick up a new window with File - New it uses the same remote port as the parent.</p>

<p>I have 3 files. main.c stop_watch.h and stop_watch.c</p>

<p>1) The seconds in g_start_timer always gives rubbish. I thought I might have solved this by creating the structure on the heap. Is there anyway I can solve this. I was thinking of creating the seconds element on the heap. But think this is over kill</p>

<p>2) This program works fine, but if I comment out the line in main printf(""=== timeout_cb: %p\n"", timeout_cb); it will stack dump.</p>

<p>3) when is the best time to free the memory. I was freeing it in main. But I am worried if the memory is freed before the thread has finished. That could cause a very unexpected result. I am thinking I could use thread_join() as free the memory after this call. However, I would need to return the thead_id that is created in the stop_watch.c, is there a way to return the thread_id that is created in stop_watch.c</p>

<p><strong>The Domain Model</strong></p>

<p>Let's say I have two parallel class hierarchies: Animal, Dog, Cat and AnimalOwner, DogOwner, CatOwner where Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal and DogOwner and CatOwner both inherit from AnimalOwner. AnimalOwner has a reference of type Animal called OwnedAnimal.</p>

<p>Here are the classes in the example:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Animal
{
   // some properties
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
   // some more properties
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
   // some more properties
}

public class AnimalOwner 
{
   public virtual Animal OwnedAnimal {get;set;}
   // more properties...
}

public class DogOwner : AnimalOwner
{
   // even more properties
}

public class CatOwner : AnimalOwner
{
   // even more properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>The classes have proper nhibernate mapping, all properties are persistent and everything that can be lazy loaded is lazy loaded.</p>

<p>The application business logic only let you to set a Dog in a DogOwner and a Cat in a CatOwner.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void ProcessDogOwner(DogOwner owner)
{
   Dog dog = (Dog)owner.OwnedAnimal;
   ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method can be called by many diffrent methods, in most cases the dog is already in memory and everything is ok, but rarely the dog isn't already in memory - in this case I get an nhibernate ""uninitialized proxy"" but the cast throws an exception because nhibernate genrates a proxy for Animal and not for Dog.</p>

<p>I understand that this is how nhibernate works, but I need to know the type without loading the object - or, more correctly I need the uninitialized proxy to be a proxy of Cat or Dog and not a proxy of Animal.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I can't change the domain model, the model is handed to me by another department, I tried to get them to change the model and failed.</li>
<li>The actual model is much more complicated then the example and the classes have many references between them, using eager loading or adding joins to the queries is out of the question for performance reasons.</li>
<li>I have full control of the source code, the hbm mapping and the database schema and I can change them any way I want (as long as I don't change the relationships between the model classes).</li>
<li>I have many methods like the one in the example and I don't want to modify all of them.</li>

Currently I'm running a Tomcat server that has a servlet that responds to client requests. Each request in turn adds a processing message to an asynchronous queue (I'll probably be using JMS via Spring or more likely Amazon SQS).</p>

<p>The sequence of events is this:</p>

<p>Sending side:<br>
1. Take a client request <br>
2. Add some data into a DB related to this request with a unique ID <br>
3. Add a message object representing this request to the message queue <br></p>

<p>Receiving side: <br>
1. Pull a new message object from the queue <br>
2. Unwrap the object and grab some information from a web site based on information contained in the msg object. <br>
3. Send an email alert <br>
4. update my DB row (same unique ID) with the information that operation was completed for this request. <br></p>

<p>I'm having a hard figuring out how to properly deal with the receiving side. On one hand I can probably create a simple java program that I kick off from the command line that picks each item in the queue and processes it. Is that safe? Does it make more sense to have that program running as another thread inside the Tomcat container? I will not want to do this serially, meaning the receiving end should be able to process several objects at a time -- using multiple threads. I want this to be always running, 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>What are some options for building the receiving side?</p>

<p>My compiler warns about implicitly converting or casting certain types to bool whereas explicit conversions do not produce a warning:</p>

<pre><code>long t = 0;
bool b = false;
b = t;                    // performance warning: forcing long to bool
b = (bool)t;              // performance warning
b = bool(t);              // performance warning
b = static_cast&lt;bool&gt;(t); // performance warning
b = t ? true : false;     // ok, no warning
b = t != 0;               // ok
b = !!t;                  // ok
</code></pre>

<p>This is with Visual C++ 2008 but I suspect other compilers may have similar warnings.</p>

<p>So my question is: what is the performance implication of casting/converting to <code>bool</code>?  Does explicit conversion have better performance in some circumstance (e.g., for certain target architectures or processors)?  Does implicit conversion somehow confuse the optimizer?</p>

<p>Microsoft's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b6801kcy.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">explanation</a> of their warning is not particularly helpful.  They imply that there is a good reason but they don't explain it.</p>

What I meant by that it can only be done for selector that match only one image is that when doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:GridView ID=""ourGrid"" runat=""server"" DataSourceID=""ourDataSource"" onrowdatabound=""ourGrid_RowDataBound""
              HeaderStyle-CssClass=""header_style"" AlternatingRowStyle-CssClass=""altrow_style""

&lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID=""ourDataSource"" runat=""server"" SelectMethod=""GetTopUsers"" TypeName=""Acme.Model.OurNewObject""&gt;
&lt;/asp:ObjectDataSource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It currently generates the following markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" summary=""""&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr style=""header_style""&gt;

            &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few more HTML elements that I'd like to add to the table markup that this GridView control will generate. For starters, I need the TFOOT to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tfoot&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td colspan=""4""&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;a class=""footerlink_style"" title=""Newest Members"" href=""#""&gt;Newest Members&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;a class=""footerlink_style"" title=""Top Posters"" href=""#""&gt;Top Posters&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tfoot&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The links will not contain databound information, but will likely be Hyperlink controls.  Is there a way I can specify this at design-time?</p>

<p>Also, for the THEAD, is it possible to specify separate styles for each column header like this in the GridView?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr style=""header_style""&gt;
        &lt;th scope=""col"" style=""col1_style""&gt;Full Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope=""col"" style=""col2_style""&gt;Gender&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope=""col"" style=""col3_style""&gt;Year of Birth&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th scope=""col"" style=""col4_style""&gt;Date Joined&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, is it possible to specifiy the summary attribute of the table like this?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" summary=""Here is a list of users""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I have a container class which uses vector&lt;std::string&gt; internally. I have provided a method <em>AddChar(std::string)</em> to this wrapper class which does a <em>push_back()</em> to the internal vector. In my code, I have to add multiple items to the container some time. For that I have to use </p>

<pre><code>container.AddChar(""First"");
container.AddChar(""Second"");
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the code larger. So to make it more easier, I plan to overload operator &lt;&lt;. So that I can write</p>

<pre><code>container &lt;&lt; ""First"" &lt;&lt; ""Second""
</code></pre>

<p>and two items will get added to underlying vector.</p>

<p>Here is the code I used for that</p>

<pre><code>class ExtendedVector
{
private:
    vector&lt;string&gt; container;

public:
    friend ExtendedVector&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ExtendedVector&amp; cont,const std::string str){
        cont.AddChar(str);
        return cont;
    }

    void AddChar(const std::string str)
    {
        container.push_back(str);
    }

    string ToString()
    {
        string output;
        vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator it = container.begin();
        while(it != container.end())
        {
            output += *it;
            ++it;
        }
        return output;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>It is working as expected. </p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is operator overload written correctly?</li>
<li>Is it a good practice to overload operators in situations like this?</li>
<li>Will there be any performance issues or any other issues with this code?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>After hearing the excellent comments, I decided not to overload &lt;&lt; as it doesn't make sense here. I removed the operator overload code and here is the final code.</p>

<pre><code>class ExtendedVector
{
private:
    vector&lt;string&gt; container;

public:

    ExtendedVector&amp; AddChar(const std::string str)
    {
        container.push_back(str);
        return *this;
    }

         .. other methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to add </p>

<pre><code>container.AddChar(""First"").AddChar(""Second"")
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, I can do this more easily by using the params keyword. Code will be like</p>

<pre><code>void AddChar(params string[] str)
{
    foreach(string s in str)
       // add to the underlying collection
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know in C++, we can use <em>...</em> to specify variable langth of parameters. But AFAIK, it is not type safe. So is it a recommended practice to do so? So that I can write</p>

<pre><code>container.AddChar(""First"",""Second"")
</code></pre>

<p>Is the compiler simple enforcing scope by refusing to let me use the variable? If so this makes sense.</p>

<p>===========</p>

<p>Edited: </p>

<p>I guess what I also find interesting is how you can have the same variable within two child scopes in a single method, so this is valid:</p>

<pre><code>        {
            string thisWorks= string.Empty;
        }
        {

</code></pre>

<p>I'm just a little curious that you can have two variables with the same name as long as they are at the same level (if you look at scope as a tree). This makes sense because you can have local variables in two methods of the same class with the same name. </p>

<p>I'm just surprised that the compiler is able to differentiate and allow this, while it wouldn't allow the postParent variable. And is this a technical limitation or was this a design decision? That's what I'm really trying to get at;-)</p>

<p>I want to provide the ability to the users to be able to debug the scripts written by them, using the Visual Studio Debugger. Note that the scripts are run in the hosted environment and not through the IronPython executable (ipy.exe).</p>

<p>After a bit of Reflector magic on the IronPython assemblies, I came up with something which lets me do that, but I'm not sure if this is the prescribed way. Basically what I do is create a ""ScriptRuntime"" object with the ""DebugMode"" property set to true and then create a python based ""ScriptEngine"" from the ""ScriptRuntime"", which I use for hosting. Code below.</p>

<pre><code>        ScriptRuntimeSetup setup = new ScriptRuntimeSetup();
        setup.DebugMode = true;
        setup.LanguageSetups.Add(Python.CreateLanguageSetup(null));

        ScriptRuntime runtime = new ScriptRuntime(setup);
        ScriptEngine engine = runtime.GetEngineByTypeName(typeof(PythonContext).AssemblyQualifiedName);
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I execute the scripts in the hosted environment, using:</p>

<pre><code>            ScriptSource script = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromFile(path);
            CompiledCode code = script.Compile();
            ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope();
            script.Execute(scope);
</code></pre>

<p>I can place breakpoints in the script files and they get hit, when the script is executed.</p>

<p>So, is there a better/easier way to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I prepared a full <a href=""http://www.aussiedesignedsoftware.com/files/WPFDispatchDemoSrc.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sample</a> along with some <a href=""http://aussiedesignedsoftware.com/blog/?p=51"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UML diagrams</a> of the first two of three approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Click event handlers on buttons and menus.</li>
<li>Use commands bound in XAML.</li>
<li>Use commands bound in code, with the XAML kept for pure GUI layout and styling.</li>
</ol>

<p>The introductory course he'd been on and many of the books show simple Click event handlers as the natural way to connect logic to UI objects.</p>

<p>He was a bit stunned by the amount of overhead required to use commands with both the command being created in the code behind file:</p>

<pre><code>public static readonly ICommand cmdShow2 = new RoutedUICommand(
  ""Show Window2"", ""cmdShow2"", 
  typeof(TestDespatchWindow));
</code></pre>

<p>and then even more code in the XAML with the wordy way the command has to be identified and bound:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=""WPFDispatchDemo.TestDespatchWindow""
  xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
  xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
  xmlns:w=""clr-namespace:WPFDispatchDemo""..&gt;

    &lt;Window.CommandBindings&gt;
      &lt;CommandBinding Command=""{x:Static w:TestDespatchWindow.cmdShow2}""
        Executed=""OnShow2"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Window.CommandBindings&gt;
      &lt;DockPanel&gt;
        &lt;StackPanel Margin=""0,8,0,0""&gt;
          &lt;Button x:Name=""Show2EventBased"" 
                  Margin=""10,2,10,2"" 
                  Click=""OnShow2"" 
                  Content=""Show2 via WPF Event""/&gt;
          &lt;Button x:Name=""Show2Command"" 
                  Command=""{x:Static w:TestDespatchWindow.cmdShow2}""
                  Margin=""10,2,10,2"" 
                  Content=""Show2 via WPF""/&gt;
        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;/DockPanel&gt;
  &lt;/Window&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can't (yet) claim to be a WPF expert so I may have painted things as more complex than they really are but my suspicion is that you can't simplify things much more than the above.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Conclusion:
The way I found my bug was the watchdog breadcrumbs.  </p>

<p>I am using a PIC that has a high and low ISR vector.  The High vector was suppose to handle the LED matrix and the Low vector was to handle the timer tick.  But I put both ISR handlers in the high vector.  So when I disabled the LED matrix ISR and the timer tick ISR needed service, the processor would be stuck in the low ISR to handle the timer tick, but the timer tick handler was not there.</p>

<p>The breadcrumbs limited my search down to the function that handled the led matrix and specifically disabling the LED matrix interrupt.</p>

<p>My problem is that sometimes users will try to refresh a page which will cause the viewstate to be lost, other times the user might want to bookmark a page but when the get back the viewstate will be lost.</p>

<p>Modern browsers will display a silly dialog when a user tries to refresh a page that is the result of a POST operation (e.g. asp postback) which is not desirable at all.</p>

<p>I wonder is their a way to continue using ViewState and the postback model but without the drawback of the refresh dialog box. (and if possible bookmark the page.)</p>

<p>An example of what i might want to do is having a page with records and checkboxes next to them, the user has the option to check all the records they want to delete and then click on a delete button. After the user clicks delete the records are analyzed on the server and the new page lists all the records that were selected with a confirm delete button. Now if the user clicks refresh they get this silly box to confirm if they want to post or not.</p>

<p>I understant that ViewState is the result of using the Post Back model which means that most asp.net pages are the result of a POST operation, but i wonder if there are any ways around it.</p>

<p>Workarounds that i thought might work: <br />
In the Page_Unload event save the viewstate in the session with a unique id and redirect the user to the same page with the unique id as a query string parameter, after the page loads with a unique id in the url the viewstate is loaded from the session and injected into the current page. Such a method will allow to user to refresh the page and always get back the same results.</p>

<p>P.S.
I understand that i can use <code>Response.Redirect()</code> and/or query strings but i want to use the simplicity of <code>ViewState</code></p>

<p>Headers make sense when I have multiple visible columns and whatnot, but sometimes it would be nice to hide it.</p>

<p>To give a simple example, let's say I have a combobox that displays whether something is active or not.  There's a label next to it that says ""Active"".  The combobox has one visible column with two rows -- ""Yes"" and ""No"".</p>

<p>Once a client certificate has been used to authenticate successfully it stays in the browser's SSL cache until the process is closed or the user manually clears the SSL cache. We want to be able to clear the SSL cache whenever a user logs out, or their session expires, to improve the security of the system. </p>

<p>Our clients already use smartcards to access the system, which unload certificates automatically when the card is removed from the client computer, but this does not clear the browser cache at all, leaving a potential avenue of attack from another user who had access to the same machine as the genuine user.</p>

<p>I've found out how to do the actual cache clearing from JavaScript:</p>

<p>document.execCommand(""ClearAuthenticationCache"");</p>

<p>which works perfectly when a user explicitly logs out, as we can execute the script on the client before allowing the user to log in again.</p>

<p>NOTE: IE7 only lets the cache be cleared programmatically when HTTP Keep-Alives are disabled on the web server.</p>

<p>Here's the tricky bit - if a client's session expires, I don't know of any way to handle this in the browser before the user tries to login again. I can't clear the state when they get to the login page, because I need the state cleared and a new certificate chosen before the page executes on the server.</p>

<p>Extra info: The handle will be the inherited STDOUT of a child process, so I need any output from that process to immediately be written to disk.</p>

<p>Studying the <code>CreateFile</code> documentation, the <code>FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH</code> flag looked like exactly what I need:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write operations will not go through
  any intermediate cache, they will go
  directly to disk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote a very basic test program and, well, it's not working. 
I used the flag on CreateFile then used <code>WriteFile(myHandle,...)</code> in a long loop, writing about 100MB of data in about 15 seconds. (I added some <code>Sleep()</code>'s). </p>

<p>I then set up a professional monitoring environment consisting of continuously hitting 'F5' in explorer. The results: the file stays at 0kB then jumps to 100MB about the time the test program ends.</p>

<p>Next thing I tried was to manually flush the file after each write, with <code>FlushFileBuffers(myHandle)</code>. This makes the observed file size grow nice and steady, as expected.</p>

<p>My question is, then, shouldn't the <code>FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH</code> have done this <strong>without</strong> manually flushing the file? Am I missing something?
In the 'real world' program, I can't flush the file, 'cause I don't have any control over the child process that's using it.</p>

<p>There's also the <code>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</code> flag, that I can't be used for the same reason - no control over the process that's using the handle, so I can't manually align the writes as required by this flag.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I have made a separate project specifically for watching how the size of the file changes. It uses the .NET <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filesystemwatcher.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>FileSystemWatcher</code></a> class. I also write less data - around 100kB in total.</p>

<p>Here's the output. Check out the seconds in the timestamps.</p>

    test = (indices==i);

<p>I'm trying to debug a NullPointerException I'm getting for passing a reference to statically defined field. To be more specific, I'm setting a global on a Drools3 working memory instance.</p>

<pre><code>workingMemory.setGlobal(""log"", workingMemorieslog);

<p>My assumption is that the Class where the field is statically defined is being garbage collected. (The receiving class must be using WeakReference or something like that, I don't really know)</p>

<p>How would you suggest to debug this?
I think that if I could know exactly when JVM's GC unloads a class / instance of a class then I could narrow down on the cause of the buggy behavior. (If not the exact time of the event at least getting an indication that something did happened).</p>

<p>On most Linux distributions that I tried, some Perl modules would be available through the package manager. Others, of course, not. For quite a while I would use my package manager whenever I needed to install some CPAN module to find out whether a package was available or not and to install it when it was.</p>

<p>The obvious advantage is that you get your modules updated whenever a new version of the package becomes available.</p>

<p>However, you get in trouble when the module is not available in pre-packaged form and there are dependencies for that module that are. Firing up your package manager every time the cpan shell asks whether it should follow a dependency can be quite tiring.</p>

<p>Often, another drawback is the version of the pre-packaged module. If you are running Debian or Ubuntu you will soon find out that you will not be able to live on the bleeding edge, like many CPAN module authors seem to do.  </p>

<p>How do other Perl people on Linux handle that problem? Do you just ignore what your package managers have to offer? Are there any tools that make apt (for example) and cpan better team mates? Or do you simply not install anything via the cpan shell?</p>

Some documents were scanned at 200dpi, some at 300dpi, and some at 600dpi.  Since DjVu is a pixel-based format, I want to be sure I use the same resolution in the target DjVu file as was used for the scan.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what program I can run, or how I can write a program, to determine what resolution was used to produce a scanned PDF?  (Number of pixels might work too as almost all documents are 8.5 by 11 inches.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Clarification after responses: I'm aware of the difficulties highlighted by Breton, and I'm willing to concede that the problem in general is ill-posed, but I'm not asking about <em>general</em> PDF documents.  My particular documents came out of a scanner.  They contain one scanned image per page, same resolution each page.  If I convert the PDF to PostScript I can poke around by hand and find pixel dimensions easily; I could probably find image sizes with more work.  And if in desperate need I could modify the dictionary stack that <code>gs</code> is using; long ago, I wrote an interpreter for PostScript Level 1.</p>

<p>All of that is what I'm trying to avoid.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to help received, I've posted an answer below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the bounding box from the PDF using <code>identify</code>, taking only the output for the first page, and understanding that the units will be PostScript points, of which there are 72 to an inch.</li>
<li>Extract images from the first page using <code>pdfimages</code>.</li>
<li>Get height and width of image.  This time <code>identify</code> will give number of pixels.</li>
<li>Add the total <em>areas</em> of the images to get the number of dots squared.</li>
<li>To get resolution, compute areas of bounding box in inches squared, divide dots squared by inches squared, take the square root, and round to the nearest multiple of 10.</li>
</ol>

"29989535","1","29989882","","2015-04-26 21:58:39","","3","8803","<p>Okay I'm having a simple REST API that is now running. I also got a mobile app (Android) that would be ready for some network communication. But here is the thing:</p>

<p>I now got a fancy API created with <a href=""https://spring.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">Spring</a> that I can use with Http-Requests:</p>

<pre><code>package com.helloworld

@Controller
@RequestMapping(""/helloWorld"")
public class HelloWorldController {

    @RequestMapping(value = ""/hello"", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String hello(ModelMap model) {
        model.addAttribute(""msg"", ""JCG Hello World!"");
        return ""helloWorld"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is all fine but how would I use this API in my Android mobile App? What I mean is that I don't know how to make those calls more elegantly and simple! I don't want to write for every request on my API something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class HelloWorldTask extends AsyncTask&lt;String, String, String&gt; {

    private String url = ""http://192.168.42.229:8080/HelloWorldExample/helloWorld/displayMessage/"" + msg; 

    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(String... uri) {

        String msg = """";
        for(String m : uri) { msg += m; }    

        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();    
        restTemplate.getMessageConverters().add(new StringHttpMessageConverter());
        return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class, ""Android"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to avoid this? To be honest I believed that I would be able to just import something like a <code>helloworld-api.jar</code> after building my REST API project and then do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import com.helloworld

public void getServerHello() {

    HelloWorldController api;

    HelloWorld helloWorld = api.getHelloWorldMapping();
    helloWorld.displayMessage(""How are you?"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that this will be it. So is there a way to do something like this when writing a Spring REST API or will I really have to use something like a URI-builder and create for all kind of requests an additional <code>class &lt;whatever&gt;Task extends AsyncTask&lt;?, ?, ?&gt;</code> by myself? </p>

<p>Since the API is clearly defined it should be possible to do something like this, but is it?</p>

<p>I hope my question is clear - please let me know if not.</p>

<p>How do I transform a Range of text in Excel?  Do I need to coy it over to another sheet and then pass over that data with the neccesarry formatting functions the run my Dump to text routine?  I currently had planned to have a function for each column but I am having trouble figuring out how to take the next step.  I am fairly new at Office programming and developing in general so any insight will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>My Global.asax calls a static BootStrapper class which registers all my dependencies but it looks like the StructureMapControllerFactory's GetControllerInstance is getting called twice. The first time it's called, a proper controllerType is passed in but it's always null on the second calling.</p>

<p>The first time GetControllerInstance is called, the type is set to HomeController which is correct. The code the fires in HomeController and it returns the View(). On the return of the View(), the Page_Load event is called on the aspx file. After stepping through that, it arrives at a line:</p>

<p>httpHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext.Current);</p>

<p>That's where the GetControllerInstance is called the second time.</p>

<p>Here's my Global.asax bits which may be relevant:</p>

<p>I have a C# class which uses ODP.net to connect to an Oracle DB and run a procedure that's in a package.  </p>

<p>My package has stored procedures which take a ref cursor output parameter.  All the procedure does is open up the cursor for a particular select statement.</p>

<p>If I execute this procedure directly on the oracle db, then eventually I'll hit a max number of open cursors error.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if ODP.net does indeed close this cursor that was opened in my procedure?</p>

<p>I'm using the OracleDataApaper.Fill(DataSet) method.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>DataSet ds = new DataSet();
OracleConnection conn = new OracleConnection(this.connStr);
OracleCommand com = new OracleCommand(""MYPKG.MYQUERY"", conn);
OracleDataAdapter adapter = new OracleDataAdapter(com);
conn.Open();
com.Parameters.Add(""searchParam"", OracleDbType.Varchar2).Value = ""myName"";
com.Parameters.Add(""outCursor"", OracleDbType.RefCursor, ParameterDirection.Output);
com.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

adapter.Fill(ds);
conn.Close();




PROCEDURE GETALLEMAILS(searchParamIN VARCHAR2, outCursor OUT sys_refcursor) AS
  BEGIN
    open outCursor
      select 
        EAEMAL as Email
      from 
        EmailTable
      where 
        EmailName = searchParam;  
  END GETALLEMAILS;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm just afraid of leaving open cursors behind on the DB is all.  If anyone can provide links to official documentation, that'd be great!</p>

<hr>

<p>Updates:</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.  I was calling</p>

<pre><code>com.Dispose();
conn.Close();
conn.Dispose();
</code></pre>

<p>but left them out of my example.</p>

<p>I found this forum post, which states that the OracleDataAdapter.Fill(Dataset) method does release the ref cursor after the Fill() method has been executed.

"472059","1","","","2009-01-23 06:22:10","","3","8819","<p>I am using a <code>dijit.form.FilteringSelect</code> backed by a <code>dojox.data.QueryReadStore</code> in order to allow the user to select a region (think ""auto-complete"" mechanism).  On each character entered by the user, the <code>QueryReadStore</code> sends a request to the server, awaiting a json list of matching regions (with associated IDs).  By the time a short enough list is shown, the user picks the desired item.  [Admittedly, querying on every keystroke is not the most efficient pattern, but it's good enough for now.]</p>

<p>Unexpected behaviour:  in some rare but specific occasions, the choice made by the user ""doesn't stick"".  For instance, if the user types ""<code>can</code>"", she is presented with the following choices in that order:</p>

<pre><code>Atlantic Canada
Canada
English Canada
Lower Canada
Upper Canada
Western Canada
</code></pre>

<p>If she chooses ""<code>Canada</code>"" among these, the dijit closes the drop down selection, having correctly selected her choice.  But by the time the user leaves the field, the selection switches to ""<code>Atlantic Canada</code>""!</p>

<p>That bizarre phenomenon occurs systematically for a small number of specific regions.  (At first, I thought that the common factor between those badly behaved regions was that their name contained accented characters or hyphens, but clearly not so with the Canadian example.  So far, I fail to spot a regular pattern.)</p>

<p>I have not found any mention of a similar problem anywhere.  I am quite willing to investigate, but, as I am new to dojo, I would really appreciate pointers before I resort to delving inside dojo's code:  where should I first look?  what are some likely problems that could cause that behaviour? can i rule out certain hypotheses? how should I best use the console (or Firebug) to get to the bottom of this?  etc.</p>

<p>The problem occurs with both dojo 1.1.1 and dojo 1.2.3.</p>

<p>Here is the (programmatic) generation of the <code>FilteringSelect</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new dijit.form.FilteringSelect({
   name = ""region"";
   autoComplete = false;
   hasDownArrow = false;
   labelAttr = ""name"";
   queryExpr = ""${0}"";
   store = new dojox.data.QueryReadStore({url:'/query/regions'});
}, myNode);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT (2009/02/18): Additional details</strong></p>

<p>Following damelin's answer, I wanted to understand what <code>FilteringSelect</code> saw of this situation.  Suppose I connect logging functions to the <code>FilteringSelect</code>'s events <code>onChange</code> and <code>onBlur</code>, I get the following play-by-play sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>I click in the field and type: <code>can</code></li>
<li>drop-down list of 6 regions (listed above) appears</li>
<li>with the keyboard cursors, I move down the list to ""<code>Canada</code>"" (which is region with id 1)</li>
<li><p>I press <code>Enter</code> (thus <strong>selecting</strong> an item of the store).  The drop-down list has by now disappeared and the text ""<code>Canada</code>"" appears in the field.  At this point, the first event is fired, with the following logging:</p>

<pre><code>onChange event: region 1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>I leave the field by pressing <code>tab</code>.  Here, two events are fired one after the other, in the following order:</p>

<pre><code>onBlur event: region 1
onChange event: region 246
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>(Region 246 is <code>Atlantic Canada</code>.) Now that's very interesting...  By the time I leave the field (onBlur), <code>Canada</code> still is the selected value.  The mysterious swap happens only after that...</p>

We have a lot of very similar projects with standard layouts and defined standards for handover areas and so having an XML file that defines what the developers want to happen rather than describing how it needs to be done would greatly help the uptake of the build service.</p>

<p>I want to define early on in the product build XML file the build modes to be used, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Build&gt;
    &lt;BuildModes&gt;
        &lt;Mode name=""Debug"" /&gt;
        &lt;Mode name=""Release"" /&gt;
    &lt;/BuildModes&gt;

    &lt;ItemsToBuild&gt;
        &lt;Item name=""first item"" .... /&gt;
        &lt;Item name=""second item"" .... /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemsToBuild&gt;
 &lt;/Build&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to have an </p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""/Build/BuildModes/Mode""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:for-each select=""/Build/ItemsToBuild/Item""&gt;
        &lt;exec program=""devenv""&gt;
        &lt;xsl:attribute name=""line""&gt;
            use the @name from the Mode and other stuff from Item to build up the command line
        &lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I can do it by having a  defined between the two for-each lines to hold the Mode/@name value but that's a bit messy, and what I actually want to do is flip the nexting around so that the build mode is inside the Item loop so it builds one mode then the other.  At the moment it would build all of the debug and then all of the release builds.  To do that I would have to have several  declared and that's getting very messy.</p>

<p>So it's nested  when the elements in the source document are not nested.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>ok, as the accepted answer below shows using for-each is a bad idea in most cases, and I have reworked this example into the following.  It's slightly different as the schema I'm using was simplified for the above post but you get the idea.</p>

<p>We're using the <strong>Castle</strong> stack (Monorail through to nHibernate with ActiveRecord).</p>

<p>We have marked the aggregate roots as lazy <code>[ActiveRecord(Lazy = true)]</code> and have customized 'eager' routines on our Repository to eager fetch an object graph. We use HQL to define eager fetches from our child collection of our root, </p>

<p>e.g. if <code>Account</code> is the aggregate root (and marked lazy loaded) we'll eager fetch <code>Account .. Order .. Product</code> entities for a complete graph.</p>

<p>So no surprises so far (hopefully). </p>

<p>Now if in the above example, Product is also marked <code>[ActiveRecord(Lazy = true)]</code>, this seems to stop the eager fetch directive in the HQL. </p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know a way to force the eager fetch of a lazy loaded child object</strong> ??</p>

<p>Cheers
ian</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>Ok here's some example hql, Using the example from 'me.yahoo.com/../1' below, we're using IMuliQuery to reslove N+1 dependencies when fetching over many-to-many relationships. We're also explicitly using many-to-many mapping classes. As a result our hql is:</p>

<pre><code>from Account a 'm eager loading the graph
inner join fetch a.AccountsOrders ao 
inner join fetch ao.Order
from Account a 'm eager loading the graph
inner join fetch a.AccountAddresses aa
inner join fetch aa.Address ad
where a.ID = ?
</code></pre>

<p>... so this executes the 2 sql statements and returns the required minimal rowset, and we can resolve this down into a single object graph. Nice.</p>

<p>But... if, say, <code>Address</code> was marked lazy loaded (and <code>Order</code> wasn't), accessing <code>Order</code> doesn't trigger a further sql statements, yet accessing <code>Address</code> does, despite the fact both are eager loaded.</p>

<p>So why isn't the lazy loaded entity <code>Address</code>, above, eager fetched by the above statement?</p>

My general rule-of-thumb is to wrap an operation in a lock when it reads or writes to a static variable. But when a static variable is ONLY read (e.g. it's a readonly that is set during type initialization), accessing it doesn't need to be wrapped in a lock statement, right? I recently saw some code that looked like the following example, and it made me think there may be some gaps in my multithreading knowledge:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    private static readonly string bar = ""O_o"";

    private bool TrySomething()
    {
        string bar;

        lock(Foo.objectToLockOn)
        {
            bar = Foo.bar;          
        }       

        // Do something with bar
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That just doesn't make sense to me--why would there by concurrency issues with READING a register?</p>

<p>Also, this example brings up another question. Is one of these better than the other? (E.g. example two holds the lock for less time?) I suppose I could disassemble the MSIL...</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    private static string joke = ""yo momma"";

    private string GetJoke()
    {
        lock(Foo.objectToLockOn)
        {
            return Foo.joke;
        }
    }

<h3>Keep track of object instances</h3>

<p>Working with multiple instances of a given class? How can you tell them apart?
In pre-garbage collection programming days, it was easy to keep track of references - just look at the memory address. With .NET, you can't do that - objects can get moved around.
Fortunately, the watches view lets you right-click on a watch and select 'Make Object ID'. </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=""http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/461/52518188cq3.jpg"">watches view http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/461/52518188cq3.jpg</a> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This appends a {1#}, {2#} etc. after the instance's value, effectively giving the instance a unique label. It looks like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href=""http://img383.imageshack.us/img383/7351/11732685bl8.jpg"">numbered instance http://img383.imageshack.us/img383/7351/11732685bl8.jpg</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The label is persisted for the lifetime of that object.</p>

<h3>Meaningful values for watched variables</h3>

<p>By default, a watched variable's value is it's type. If you want to see its fields, you have to expand it, and this could take a long time (or even timeout!) if there are many fields or they do something complicated.</p>

<p>However, some predefined types show more meaningful information :</p>

<ul>
<li>strings show their actual contents</li>
<li>lists and dictionaries show their elements count etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4808/37220487md1.jpg"">meaningful info http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4808/37220487md1.jpg</a></p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have that for my own types? </p>

<p>Hmm... </p>

<p>...some quality time with .NET Reflector shows how easily this can be accomplished with the <code>DebuggerDisplay</code> attribute on my custom type:</p>

<pre><code>[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerDisplay(""Employee: '{Name}'"")]
public class Employee {
    public string Name { get { ... } }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>... re-run, and...</p>

<p><a href=""http://img60.imageshack.us/img60/926/79816018ha1.jpg"">ta da! http://img60.imageshack.us/img60/926/79816018ha1.jpg</a></p>

<h3>Break on all exceptions</h3>

<p>... even the ones that are handled in code!
I know, I'm such a n00b for not knowing about this ever since I was born, but here it goes anyway - maybe this will help someone someday:</p>

<p>You can force a debugged process to break into debug mode each time an exception is thrown. Ever went on a bug hunt for hours only to come across a piece of code like this?</p>

<pre><code>try {
    runStrangeContraption();
} catch(Exception ex) {
    /* TODO: Will handle this error later */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Catching all exceptions is really handy in these cases.
This can be enabled from <em>Debug > Exceptions... (Ctrl-Alt-E)</em>. Tick the boxes in the 'Thrown' column for each type of exception you need.</p>

<p>Those were a few forehead-slapping moments for me.

<p>This causes a problem in ASP.NET validators if an event is triggered programmatically, like when triggering an event through jQuery. In this case, the <code>window.event</code> object stores the last user-triggered event.</p>

<p>When the <code>onchange</code> event is fired programmatically for a text box that has an ASP.NET validator attached to it, the validation breaks because it is looking at the element that fired last event, which is not the element the validator is for.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a way around this? It seems like a problem that is solvable, but from looking online, most people just find ways to ignore the problem instead of solving it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>To explain what I'm doing specifically:</strong><br>
I'm using a jQuery time picker plugin on a text box that also has 2 ASP.NET validators associated with it. When the time is changed, I'm using an update panel to post back to the server to do some things dynamically, so I need the onchange event to fire in order to trigger the postback for that text box.</p>

<p>The jQuery time picker operates by creating a hidden unordered list that is made visible when the text box is clicked. When one of the list items is clicked, the ""change"" event is fired programmatically for the text box through jQuery's <code>change()</code> method.</p>

<p>Because the trigger for the event was a list item, IE sees the <em>list item</em> as the source of the event, not the text box, like it should.</p>

<p>I'm not too concerned with this ASP.NET validator working as soon as the text box is changed, I just need the ""<code>change</code>"" event to be processed so my postback event is called for the text box. The problem is that the validator throws an exception in IE which stops any event from being triggered.</p>

<p>Firefox (and I assume other browsers) don't have this issue. Only IE due to the different event model. Has anyone encountered this and seen how to fix it?</p>

<p>I've found this problem reported several other places, but they offer no solutions:  </p>

<pre><code>col1: entityID
col2: attributeName

<p>and I want to use HBase due to scaling issues.</p>

<p>I know that the only way to access Hbase table is using a primary key (cursor). you can get a cursor for a specific key, and iterate the rows one-by-one . </p>

<p>The issue is, that in my case, I want to be able to iterate on all 3 columns.
for example :</p>

<ul>
<li>for a given an entityID I want to get all its attriutes and values</li>
<li>for a give attributeName and value I want to all the entitiIDS
...</li>
</ul>

<p>so one idea I had is to build one Hbase table that will hold the data (table DATA, with entityID as primary index), and 2 ""index"" tables one with attributeName as a primary key, and the other  one with  value</p>

<p>each index table will hold a list of pointers (entityIDs) for the DATA table.</p>

<p>Is it a reasonable  approach ? or is is an 'abuse' of Hbase concepts ?</p>

  <p>HBase allows get operations by primary

<ul>
<li>The executable to debug is in a sub-folder of the workspace (pretty standard, I guess) but not of the actual Project from which the executable is built.</li>
<li>Eclipse and GDB have different path formats: Eclipse works with Windows paths, whereas GDB works with posix paths. Eclipse knows <code>D:\Path\To\Exe</code> whereas GDB needs <code>/cygdrive/d/Path/To/Exe</code>.</li>
<li>Eclipse <strong>insists</strong> that it can find the executable to debug when I enter the path in the ""Debug configurations..."" dialog. The ""Debug"" button is disabled until the path is correct.</li>
<li>Eclipse does not seem to take <code>${workspace_loc}</code> in that particular input box.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there some hidden option I don't know about? Have you had the problem before?</p>

<ul>
<li>Forcing Eclipse to pass the path I input to GDB --- <strong>did not work.</strong></li>
<li>Fiddling with source lookup paths and path mappings --- <strong>did not work</strong>, it's really just for source files.</li>
<li>Creating a C++ Project for the output folder where the executable is, so I could have a relative path to the exe inside the project --- <strong>did not work.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>Things I could still try</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use the <code>.gdbinit</code> file to discard the path given by Eclipse and load the real executable with posix paths --- tried that, but not very hard.</li>
<li>Specify a wrapper as argument to GDB --- pollutes the root of my workspace.</li>
<li>Provide my own plug-in to deal with the case --- adds another piece of code to maintain in another language.</li>

<p>Our basic issue is  slow performance by our MOSS-based intranet-- </p>

<p>Some environment info:</p>

<p>We have a MOSS standard edition for a collaboration based site. </p>

<ul>
<li>The sitedb is 29 Gb </li>
<li>we have two  VMWare based front end
servers. (2x 32bit CPUS each)</li>
<li>less than 1000 users spread over all
timezones</li>
<li>We have one big site
collection with subsites.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General symptoms:</strong>
Loading front page and pages that have been ‘warmed-up’ is pretty decent- but pages/sites off the beaten path are very slow to load.</p>

<p>We see spikes, where a page all of a sudden takes 30 seconds to load, vs its more normal 2</p>

<p>Here’s what we have done already:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scaled way back on crawling</li>
<li>enabled object and blob caching </li>
<li>optimized VMware setup</li>
<li>followed the Microsoft IT whitepaper on MOSS sharepoint best practice (esp list size etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know what else to do here—Split into multiple site collections? </p>

<pre><code>require_once('Car.php');
require_once('Truck.php');

abstract class Auto
{
    // ... some stuff ...

    public static function Create($type)
    {
        switch ($type) {

                return new Car();
                break;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is undesirable because Car.php AND Truck.php will need to be included even though only one or the other may be needed.  As far as I know, require/include and their ..._once variation include libraries at the same scope as it's call. Is this true?</p>

<p>If so, I believe this would lead to a memory leak:</p>

<pre><code>    abstract class Auto
    {
        // ... some stuff ...

        public static function Create($type)
        {
            switch ($type) {
                case 'Truck':
                    require_once('Truck.php');
                    return new Truck();
                    break;
                case 'Car':
                default:
                    require_once('Car.php');
                    return new Car();
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It looks to me that in the 2nd example, multiple calls to Create() would lead to multiple requires because of the scope of the call even though the require_once flavor is used.</p>

<p>My question is, why does the CreateProcess work just fine on most computers and not others? I know that the path will have a space in most of the time, yet on 90% of XP machines it works.  I of course found out my issue on those 10% where it did not.  But I'm wondering what is different on the machines where it does not work?  Is there a setting or a policy that any of you folks know about.  And yes, I am going to fix the quote issue. Just curious about why something like this would not have just failed off the bat.  </p>

<li>NF and CM (compatibility mode) are settings on DB2 v8 on mainframe.</li>
<li>DB2 v8 on z/OS in CM is designed to allow DB2 v8 to be used as a drop in replacement for DB2 v7.</li>
<li>NF makes numerous changes that break backward compatibility.</li>
<li>In particular the ""data dictionary"" system tables are completely reworked.</li>

<p>I suspect the following, but I'm even less sure of it...</p>

<ol>
<li>The reworked data dictionary and system tables are similar to those used by DB2 v8 on Linux/Unix/Windows.</li>
<li>DB2 v8 NF is largely compatible with DB2 v9.</li>
<li>DB2 v9 is much more consistent across platforms (Linux/Unix/Windows and mainframe).</li>

<p>For the scenario, I build a datatable dynamically and shove it into a dataview where I put the dataview into a gridview while also remembering to put the dataview into a session object for sorting capabilities.</p>

<p>When the user calls on the gridview to sort a column, I recall the dataview in the session object and build the dataview sorting expression like this:</p>

<pre><code>dataview.sort = e.sortexpression + "" "" + e.Sortdirection; 
</code></pre>

<p>Or something along those lines.  So what ussually comes out is right for all real strings such as </p>

<p>Car; Home; scott; zach etc...</p>

<p>But when I do the same for number fields WITH comma seperated values it comes out something like</p>

<p>900;  800; 700; 600; 200; 120; 1,200; 12,340; 1,000,000;</p>

<p>See what I mean?  It just sorts the items as an alpha sort instead of a Natural sort.  I want to make my Dataview NATURALLY sort the numeric columns correctly like</p>

<p>120; 200; 600; 700; 800; 900; 1,200; 12,340; 1,000,000;</p>

<p>Let me know what you can do to help me out.<br>
P.S. I have looked through countless articles on how to do this and all of them say to shove into a List/Array and do it that way, but is there a much more efficient way?</p>

  v = property(fget=get, fset=set, doc='value of parameter')

par1 = SingleParameter(name='par1', default_value=10, unit='mV')
par2 = SingleParameter(name='par2', default_value=20, unit='mA')

# par1 and par2 I can access perfectly via 'p1.v = ...'
# or get its value with 'p1.v'

class Collection(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.dict = {}
  def __getitem__(self, name):
    return self.dict[name] # get the whole object
    # to get the value instead:
    # return self.dict[name].v
  def add(self, parameter):
    self.dict[parameter.name] = parameter
    # now comes the part that I don't know how to implement with property():
    # It shoule be something like
    # self.__dict__[parameter.name] = property(...) ?

col = Collection()
col.add(par1)
col.add(par2)
col['par1'] # gives the whole object

# Now here is what I would like to get:
# col.par1 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v
# col.par1 = 5 -&gt; should result like col['par1'].v = 5

I am binding some data objects to a TreeView control and then wanting to select a specific item programaticly given that business object's ID.  I dont see why it's so hard to travers the visual tree and find the element i want, as the data object's ID is in the Tag property of the appropriate visual element.  I'm using Mole and I am able to find the UI element with the appropriate ID in it's Tag.  I just cannot find the visual element in code.  LogicalTreeHelper does not traverse any items in the tree.

As part of the regular operation of this application modifications are made to the pages that are displayed by the ActiveX WebBrowser control. Part of these modifications involve setting a JavaScript variable in a web page being loaded into the ActiveX WebBrowser. </p>

<p>We need to initialize this variable within C# (originally, VB6 code was initializing the value). The value of this variable is a COM-visible class object. </p>

<p>However, for simplicity we've reduced the problem to setting a string value. Our original page involves frames and the like but the same problems happens in a page like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
 &lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Test&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;SCRIPT type=""text/javascript""&gt;
   var field = 'hello world';
  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
 &lt;/HEAD&gt;
 &lt;BODY&gt;
   &lt;input type=""button"" value=""See field"" onclick=""javascript:alert(field);""/&gt;
 &lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We want to access the <em>field</em> variable and assign a value to it. In VB6 the code for this was pretty straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>doc.Script.field = 'newValue'
</code></pre>

<p>However, in C# we've had to resort to other tricks, like this: </p>

<pre><code>Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.NewLateBinding.LateSet(Script, null, ""field"",new object[] { ""newValue""},null, null);
</code></pre>

<p>The point of the page is to test whether our variable was properly assigned by C#. Clicking on the button should yield whatever new value was injected by C#. So for example,  clicking on the button in the page we get an alert showing: ""newValue"".</p>

<p>That works the first time, but it doesn't work if we reload the page. On subsequent calls we cannot set the value of the variable <code>field</code>. </p>

<p>Has anyone had any experience doing this type of operation before?</p>

The stored procedure is owned by an admin; the stored procedure takes a query and executes it, then the results are returned to the application.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't figure out why the application can call the stored procedure to which it's granted access, but the stored procedure cannot execute the SQL statement which was passed into it.</p>

<p>The stored procedure executes the passed in query when I'm logged in as an admin, but when I log in as the limited user it throws an exception in the execute statement.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>EXEC [Admin].[STORED_PROC] @SQL_STATEMENT = 'SELECT * FROM table_x'
</code></pre>

<p>the STORED_PROC looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN TRY
   EXEC (@SQL_STATEMENT)
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
   -- some logging when an exception is caught, and the exception is caught here!!!
END CATCH

<p>There is nothing inside the the try catch statement except that EXEC... and the SQL_STATEMENT works when I'm logged in as the Admin, but not when I'm logged in as the User.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me figure out what permissions I need to set in order to allow the User to run queries through the stored proc only?</p>

<hr>

<p>So there have been some comments about allowing raw SQL statements to be executed via stored proc defeats the purpose of using a stored proc... but in reality what we're actually doing is we're passing an encrypted SQL statement into the stored proc and the stored proc gets the statement decrypted and THEN it executes it.</p>

<p>So yes, in reality raw SQL statements are not secure and they defeat the purpose of stored procs, but I don't know how to encrypt SQL queries that are passed through ODBC and run against a pre-2005 SQL Server.</p>

<p>In any case, I tried to put up some minimal safeguards to at least have some basic security.</p>

<p>I have two namespaces - MySpecificNamespace and MyCommonNamespace.  MyNamespace uses MyCommonNamespace, as  you might expect.</p>

<p>Now, I like to make maximum use of Namespaces wherever possible to describe the context of the problem, and avoid adding the context to the class name.  So, for example, consider that I have a class in MyNamespace which descends from one in MyCommonNamespace.</p>

<p>Option A</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> call this </p>

<pre><code>MySpecificClass: MyClass
{

<p>But then I'm adding 'Specific' (the context) to the name - which is redundant as it's already in MySpecificNamespace.  </p>

I am loading a .MDB file, displaying the contents on a DataGrid and attempting to get those changes on the DataGrid and save them back into the .MDB file. I am also going to create a function that allows me to take the tables from one .MDB file and save it to another .MDB file. Of course, I cannot do any of this if I cannot figure out how to save the changes back to the .MDB file.</p>

<p>I have researched Google extensively and there are no answers to my question. I consider myself a beginner at this specific topic so please don't make the answers too complicated -- I need the simplest way to edit a .MDB file! Please provide programming examples.</p>

<ol>
<li>Assume that I've already made a connection to a DataGrid. How do I get the changes made by the Datagrid? Im sure this one is simple enough to answer.</li>
<li>I then need to know how to take this Datatable, insert it into Dataset it came from then take that Dataset and rewrite the .MDB file. (If there is a way of only inserting the tables that were changed I would prefer that.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you in advance, let me know if you need more information. This is the last thing I am probably going to have to ask about this topic...thank god.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The .mdb I am working with is a <strong>Microsoft Access Database.</strong> ( I didnt even know there were multiple .mdb files)</p>

<p>I know I cannot write directly to the .MDB file via a streamwriter or anything but is there a way I can possibly generated a .MDB File with the DataSet information already in it? OR is there just a way that I can add tables to a .MDB file that i've already loaded into the DataGrid. There HAS to be a way!</p>

<p>Again, I need a way to do this <strong><em>PROGRAMMATICALLY</em></strong> in C#.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Okay, my project is fairly large but I use a seperate class file to handle all Database connections. I know my design and source is really sloppy, but it gets the job done. I am only as good as the examples I find on the internet.</p>

<p>Remember, I am simply connecting to a DataGrid in another form. Let me know if you want my code from the Datagrid form (I dont know why you would need it though). DatabaseHandling.cs handles 2 .MDB files. So you will see two datasets in there. I will use this eventually to take tables from one Dataset and put them into another Dataset. I just need to figure out how to save these values BACK into a .MDB file.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to do this? There has to be a way...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>From what i've researched and read...I think the answer is right under my nose. Using the ""Update()"" command. Now while this is re-assuring that there is infact a simple way of doing this, I am still left with the problem that I have no-friggin-clue how to use this update command. </p>

<p>Perhaps I can set it up like this:</p>

<pre><code>Oledb.OledbConnection cn = new Oledb.OledbConnection(); 
cn.ConnectionString = ""Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\Staff.mdb""; 
Oledb.OledbCommand cmd = new Oledb.OledbCommand(cn); 
cmd.CommandText = ""INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName) VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName)""; 
</code></pre>

<p>I think that may do it, but I dont want to manually insert anything. I want to do both of these instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take information that is changed on the Datagrid and update the Access Database File (.mdb) that I got it from</li>
<li>Create a function that allows me to take tables from another Access Database File (.mdb) and replace them in a secondary Access Database file (.mdb). Both files will use the exact same structure but will have different information in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope someone comes up with a answer for this...my project is done all that awaits is one simple answer.</p>

<p>Thank you again in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Okay...good news. I have figured out how to query the .mdb file itself (I think). Here is the code, which doesn't work because I get a runtime error due to the sql command i'm attempting to use. Which will bring me to my next question.</p>

<p><strong>New function code added to DatabaseHandling.cs:</strong></p>

<pre><code>static public void performSynchronization(string table, string tableTwoLocation)
{
    OleDbCommand cmdCopyTables = new OleDbCommand(""INSERT INTO"" + table + ""SELECT * FROM [MS Access;"" + tableTwoLocation + "";].["" + table + ""]""); // This query generates runtime error
    cmdCopyTables.Connection = dataconnectionA;
    dataconnectionA.Open();
    cmdCopyTables.ExecuteNonQuery();
    dataconnectionA.Close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I've actually managed to execute a query on the connection itself, which I believe to be the actual Access .MDB file. As I said though, the SQL query I've executed on the file doesn't work and generated a run-time error when used.</p>

<p>The command I am attempting to execute is supposed to take a table from a .MDB file and overwrite a table of the same type of a different .MDB file. The SQL command I attempted above tried to directly take a table from a .mdb file, and directly put it in another -- this isn't what I want to do. I want to take all the information from the .MDB file -- put the tables into a Datatable and then add all the Datatables to a Dataset (which i've done.) I want to do this for two .MDB files. Once I have two Datasets I want to take specific tables out of each Dataset and add them to each file like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>DataSetA >>>>----- [Add Tables
(Overwrite Them)] ----->>>>  DataSetB</li>
<li>DataSetB >>>>----- [Add Tables
(Overwrite Them)] ----->>>> DataSetA</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to take those each those Datasets and then put them BACK into each Access .MDB file they came from. Essentially keeping both databases synchronized.</p>

<p>So my questions, revised, is:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I create a SQL query that will add a table to the .MDB file by overwriting the existing one of the same name. The query should be able to be created dynamically during runtime with an array that replaces a variable with the table name I want to add.</li>
<li>How do I get the changes that were made by the Datagrid to the DataTable and put them back into a DataTable (or DataSet) so I can send them to the .MDB file?</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried to elaborate as much as possible...because I believe I am not explaing my issue very well. Now this question has grown wayyy too long. I just wish I could explain this better. :[</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to a user below I think I've almost found a fix -- the keyword <em>almost</em>.
Here is my updated DatabaseHandling.cs code below. I get a runtime error ""Datatype Mismatch."" I dont know how that could be possible considering I am trying to copy these tables into another database with the exact same setup.</p>

<p>What I want is a set of ""helper"" classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper.RetrieveByID(string id);
AHelper.RetrieveByName(string name);
AHelper.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>Since my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.</p>

<p>I could always make these methods non-static and then instantiate the objects first such as</p>

<pre>
AHelper a = new AHelper();
a.DumpToDatabase();
</pre>

<p>However, this code doesn't seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions?  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether (the situation I'm in now) or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design I'm looking for?</p>

<p>When performing a simple SUM in MySQL</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUM(price) FROM cakes WHERE ingredient = 'chocolate';
</code></pre>

<p>with <code>price</code> being an integer, it appears that the <code>SUM</code> sometimes returns a string and sometimes an integer, depending on the version of the JDBC driver.</p>

<p>Apparently the server does tell the JDBC driver that the result of <code>SUM</code> is a string, and the JDBC driver sometimes 'conveniently' converts this to an integer. (see <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=mysql-java&amp;m=116295785422117&amp;w=2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marc Matthews' explanation</a>).</p>

<p>The Java code uses some <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/beans/BeanInfo.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BeanInfo</a> and <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Introspection</a> to automagically fill in a (list of) bean(s) with the result of a query. But this obviously can't work if the datatypes differ between servers where the application is deployed.</p>

<p>I don't care wether I get a string or an integer, but I'd like to always have the same datatype, or at least know in advance which datatype I'll be getting.  </p>

<p>Is there some way to know which datatype will be returned by a MySQL <code>SUM</code> from within the Java code? Or does anyone know some better way to deal with this?</p>

<p>I have my <code>certs</code> correctly installed and can successfully load <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> pages.</p>

<p>After a successful <code>j_security_check</code> authentication via <code>https</code>, I want the now authorized page (and all subsequent pages) to load as <code>http</code>.</p>

<p>I want this all to work with <code>mod_rewrite</code> because I don't want to change application code for something that really should be simple to do on the webserver.</p>

<p>I would think this would work but it doesn't and I fear it's because <code>j_security_check</code> is bypassing <code>mod_rewrite</code> somehow.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTPS} =off
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} login\.jsp.*action=init [OR]
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} login\.jsp.*action=submit

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !login\.jsp.*action=init [OR]
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !login\.jsp.*action=submit
RewriteRule .* http://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L] &lt;--- this rule is not working or the condition is not returning true
</code></pre>

<p>I know the <code>[R,L]</code> will force the executed rule to be the last rule to run on a request and redirect accordingly.</p>

<p>I found this little jewel after a little googleing.</p>

<pre><code>mod_rewrite: My rules are ignored. Nothing is written to the rewrite log.
The most common cause of this is placing mod_rewrite directives at global scope (outside of any VirtualHost containers) but expecting the directives to apply to requests which were matched by a VirtualHost container.

In this example, the mod_rewrite configuration will be ignored for requests which are received on port 443:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^index.htm$ index.html

    &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    existing vhost directives
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Unlike most configurable features, the mod_rewrite configuration is not inherited by default within a &lt;VirtualHost &gt; container. To have global mod_rewrite directives apply to a VirtualHost, add these two extra directives to the VirtualHost container:

    &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    existing vhost directives
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteOptions Inherit
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the Inherit declaration to my single <code>virtualhost</code> declaration that points to the machine ip and <code>port 443</code> did NOT help one bit.</p>

<p>Now I know that my app server communicates on <code>9080</code> and <code>9443</code> respectively but I can't find a single <code>virtualhost</code> in the web server <code>httpd.conf</code>. </p>

<p>I did some testing with different rewrite rules while not authenticated and saw that my <code>mod rewrite</code> code worked.. </p>

<p><strong>So: how do I make websphere use mod rewrite after authentication?</strong> </p>

<p>It's like the web server is only used for unauthenticated requests and after that some blackbox container serves up everything somehow.</p>

I've got BUILTIN\Users added as a database user (before I did so, I couldn't even open the database).  I'm working under the assumption that everybody is supposed to have permissions for the ""public"" role applied to them, so I didn't do anything with role assignment.  Under tblFoo, I can use the SSMS Properties dialog (Permissions page) to add ""public"", then set explicit permissions.  Among these is ""Grant"" for SELECT.  But running</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * from tblFoo;
</code></pre>

<p>as a limited (BUILTIN\Users) account gives me an error ""Select permission denied on object 'tblFoo', database 'bar', schema 'dbo'"".  In the properties dialog, there's an ""Effective Permissions button, but it's greyed out.</p>

<p>Further, I tried creating a non-priv account called ""UserTest"", adding that at the server level, then mapping it down to the ""bar"" database.  This let me add UserTest to the ""Users or Roles"" list, which let me run ""Effective Permissions"" for the account.  No permissions are listed at all -- this doesn't seem right.  The account must be in public, and public grants (among other things) Select on tblFoo, so why doesn't the UserTest account show an effective permission?  I feel like I'm going a bit crazy here.</p>

<p>ASIDE: I am aware that many people don't like using the ""public"" role to set permissions.  This is just my tinkering time; in final design I'm sure we'll have several flexible (custom) database roles.  I'm just trying to figure out the behavior I'm seeing, so please no ""don't do that!"" answers.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Apparently I know just enough SQL Server to be a danger to myself and others.  In setting permissions (as I said, ""among others""), I had DENY CONTROL.  When I set this permission, I think I tried to look up what it did, had a vague idea, and decided on DENY.  I cannot currently recall why this seemed the thing to do, but it would appear that that was the reason I was getting permission failures.  So I'm updating my question: can anyone explain the ""CONTROL"" permission, as it pertains to tables?</p>

<p>However, it doesn't act well with more complicated queries. In the simplest case, phrase queries such as ""Stack Overflow"" will match all occurrences of Stack or Overflow in the highlighting, which gives the impression to the user that it isn't working very well.</p>

<p>I tried applying the fix <a href=""http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/15528"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> but that came with a lot of performance caveats, and at the end of the day was just plain unusable. The performance is especially an issue on wildcard queries. This is due to the way that the highlighting works; instead of just working on the querystring and the text it parses it as Lucene would and then looks for all the matches that Lucene has made; unfortunately this means that for certain wildcard queries it can be looking for matches to 2000+ clauses on large documents, and it's simply not fast enough.</p>

<p>I'm displaying a data set with 288 rows and 8 columns (2304 records) using a ScrollableDataTable and the performance leaves a lot to be desired.  An AJAX request that rerenders the control takes nearly 20 seconds to complete, compared to 7 seconds when rendering the same data using a DataTable control.</p>

<p>Metrics captured via Servlet filters and JavaScript show that virtually all of the processing time is spent on the client-side. Out of a 19.87 second request, 3.87 seconds is spent on the server... with less than .6 seconds spent querying and sorting the data.</p>

<p>Switching to a DataTable control cuts the request, response, and render cycle down to 1/3 of what I'm seeing with the ScrollableDataTable, but also removes several important features.</p>

<p><strong>And now the question:</strong></p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced performance issues with the ScrollableDataTable?  What's the most efficient way to render large amounts of tabular data in JSF/RichFaces with pinned columns and two-axis scrolling?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>We ended up writing a custom control.  Full control over the rendered components and generated JavaScript allowed us achieve a response time comparable to the DataTable.  I agree with Zack though - pagination is the correct answer.</p>

<p>As a first goal, I would like to have an <em>graphical application</em> with only 2 nodes. A ""number"" which simply outputs a fixed number, and an ""Add"" node, which takes two inputs and outputs the sum of the two.</p>

<p>As people have answered so-far, I have a rough idea of how to represent the data in code, for example in Python'y looking pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>class Number:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def eval(self):
        return self.value

class Add:
    def __init__(self, input1, input2):
        self.input1 = input1
        self.input2 = input2

    def eval(self):
        return self.input1.eval() + self.input2.eval()


a = Number(20)
b = Number(72)

adder = Add(a, b)
print adder.eval()

<p>I found some examples in the <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/37.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hibernate Community Wiki</a> where they returned true, because the object itself was mutable - <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/73.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.hibernate.org/73.html</a>. </p>

<p>Other examples in the community wiki returned false without addressing why, even though they were also mutable.</p>

<p>I have checked the JavaDoc, but it's not very clear either.</p>

<p>From the JavaDoc for <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api/org/hibernate/usertype/UserType.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">UserType</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean isMutable()
    Are objects of this type mutable?
    Returns:
        boolean
</code></pre>

<p>From JavaDoc for <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api/org/hibernate/type/Type.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Type</a>:</p>

Is there a standard or best practice when it comes to specifying how many events get downloaded or how far back or forward the calendar should go?</p>

<p>My main question though, is how to configure or set an update limit on the calendar so say a user is subscribing to the calendar using Outlook that it's only updated every few hours.  I currently have my feed cached for a few hours, but if I could have Outlook or whatever client the user is using only check for updates every few hours that would be ideal.</p>

<p>From MSDN: 
“When bWaitAll is FALSE, this function checks the handles in the array in order starting with index 0, until one of the objects is signaled. If multiple objects become signaled, the function returns the index of the first handle in the array whose object was signaled.”</p>

<p>So, now if multiple objects signal I’ll get the index of the first one. Do I have to loop though my array to see if any others have signaled?  </p>

<p>I'm using Visual Studio 2008 to create a Windows Form program in C# that calls a library written in C++.<br>
The C++ DLL analyzes measurement data, which consists of several samples. The samples are passed to the library by a function (<code>PDSetWaveSample</code>) which takes a struct as a parameter.<br>
After all samples are set, the measurement data is processed with another function (<code>PDPreProcess</code>) which also takes a struct as a parameter.<br>
The C++ DLL is holding all the measurement data in its internal data structures and does all the processing to obtain results.</p>

<p>Everything seems to function correctly until the program starts processing the measurement data. At that point the program crashes and exits with this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The program 'XXX.vshost.exe: Managed' has exited with code -1073741819 (0xc0000005). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll add some more debugging information and the C# source code later in this question.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any hints how to go forward or what probably could cause this?</strong></p>

<p>I am running Windows XP Professional, Version 2002 SP 3.</p>

<p>When the program crashes, it first gives this error message </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unhandled exception of type 'System.ExecutionEngineException' occurred in Unknown Module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the possibility to Break or Continue.  I choose to Break.</p>

<p>After that I look at the assembly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No symbols are loaded for any call stack frame. The source code cannot be displayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the debugger, the assembly at the point where the error happens looks like this:</p>

<p>I need to create a JavaScript library and have limited experience with the language. I always thought that it had native support for classes, but it is less related to Java than I had assumed. It seems that everything in JavaScript is actually a function.</p>

<p>What I have found out so far makes a lot of sense with it being a dynamic weakly typed language, but this makes it a bit of a departure for people who are used to having a strongly typed language and using a compiler to spot our errors :)</p>

<p>I mainly work in C# and Java, and was hoping for something syntacticaly similar so the library would look familiar for our other C# developers that will have to maintain it.</p>

<p>I have the following sort of code which works, but I was wondering what other developer's takes would be on this. What are the alternatives? Is there a way that is better? Is there a way that is more readable?</p>

<p>I understand that what I want is something similar to C# or Java when I should just accept the fact that this <strong>is JavaScript</strong>, but my aim is to try to ease the learning curve for other developers by making it more familiar and intuitive for them.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with the 'dual core' thing.</p>

<p>There is a locked method invocation that every request uses, but it is really fast, I don't think this is the problem.</p>

<p>The more cpu-costly part of my code is the call of a dll via COM (the same external method is called from all threads). This dll is also no Memory or IO-bounded, it is an AI recognition component, I'm doing an OCR recognition of paychecks, a paycheck for request.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>

<p>It is very probable that the STA COM Method is my problem, I contacted the component owners in order to solve this problem.</p>

"116762","1","116844","","2008-09-22 18:56:12","","12","8944","<p>I have a question about best practices regarding how one should approach storing complex workflow states for processing tasks in a database.  I've been looking online to no avail, so I figured I'd ask the community what they thought was best.</p>

<p>This question comes out of the same ""BoxItem"" example I gave in a prior question.  This ""BoxItem"" is being tracked in my system as various tasks are performed on it.  The task may take place over several days and with human interaction, so the state of the BoxItem must be persisted.  Who did the task (if applicable), and when the task was done must also be tracked.</p>

<p>At first, I approached this by adding three fields to the ""BoxItems"" table for every human-interactive task that needed to be done:</p>

<p>Is<em>TaskName</em>Complete</p>

<p>Date<em>TaskName</em>Complete</p>

<p>User<em>TaskName</em>Complete</p>

<p>This worked when the workflow was simple... but now that it has grown to a complex process (> 10 possible human interactions in the flow... about half of which are optional, and may or may not be done for the BoxItem, which resulted in me beginning to add ""Do<em>TaskName</em>"" fields as well for those optional tasks), I've found that what should've been a simple table now has 40 or so field devoted entirely to the retaining of this state information.</p>

<p>I find myself asking if there isn't a better way to do it... but I'm at a loss.</p>

<p>My first thought was to make a generic ""BoxItemTasks"" table which defined the tasks that may be done on a given box, but I still would need to save the Date and User information individually, so it didn't really help.</p>

<p>My second thought was that perhaps it didn't matter, and I shouldn't worry if this table has 40 or more fields devoted to state retaining... and maybe I'm just being paranoid.  But it feels like that's a lot of information to retain.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'm at a loss as far as what a third option might be, or if one of the two options above is actually reasonable.  I can see this workflow potentially getting even more complex in the future, and for each new task I'm going to need to add 3-4 fields just to support the tracking of it... it feels like it's spiraling out of control.</p>

<p>What would you do in this situation?</p>

<p>I should note that this is maintenance of an existing system, one that was built without an ORM, so I can't just leave it up to the ORM to take care of it.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Kev, are you talking about doing something like this:</p>

<h2>BoxItems</h2>

<p>(PK) BoxItemID</p>

<p>(Other irrelevant stuff)</p>

<h2>BoxItemActions</h2>

<p>(PK) BoxItemID</p>

<p>(PK) BoxItemTaskID</p>

<p>IsCompleted</p>

<p>DateCompleted</p>

<p>UserCompleted</p>

<h2>BoxItemTasks</h2>

<p>(PK) TaskType</p>

<p>Description (if even necessary)</p>

<p>Hmm... that would work... it would represent a need to change how I currently approach doing SQL Queries to see which items are in what state, but in the long term something like this looks like it would work better (without having to make a fundamental design change like the Serialization idea represents... though if I had the time, I'd like to do it that way I think.).</p>

<p>So is this what you were mentioning Kin, or am I off on it?</p>

<p>EDIT: Ah, I see your idea as well with the ""Last Action"" to determine the current state... I like it!  I think that might work for me... I might have to change it up a little bit (because at some point tasks happen concurrently), but the idea seems like a good one!</p>

<p>EDIT FINAL:  So in summation, if anyone else is looking this up in the future with the same question... it sounds like the serialization approach would be useful if your system has the information pre-loaded into some interface where it's queryable (i.e. not directly calling the database itself, as the ad-hoc system I'm working on does), but if you don't have that, the additional tables idea seems like it should work well!  Thank you all for your responses!</p>

<p><strong>Debugging:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>From Joe Van Dyk: Try accessing the model via a console on the environment / instance that is causing the error (in the case above: script/console production then type in 'Announcement'.</p></li>
<li><p>From Otto: Try setting a minimal plugin set via an initializer, eg: config.plugins = [ :exception_notification, :ssl_requirement, :all ] then re-enable one at a time.</p></li>

<li><p>From Ian Terrell: if you're using attachment_fu make sure you have the correct image processor installed. attachment_fu will require it even if you aren't attaching an image.</p></li>
<li><p>From Otto: make sure you didn't name a model that conflicts with a built-in Rails class, eg: Request.</p></li>

<p>I'd like to be able to place expectations that certain constructors are being called, rather than having an extra bit of code to check the type (as it won't always be as convoluted and simple as my example).</p>

<p>So instead of:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>assertTrue(a.createObject() instanceof Integer);

<p>Please excuse the simple example, the actual problem I'm working on is a bit more complicated, but having the expectation would simplify it.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a bit more background:</p>

<p>I have a simple factory method, which creates wrapper objects. The objects being wrapped can require parameters which are difficult to obtain in a test class (it's pre-existing code), so it is difficult to construct them.</p>

<p>Perhaps closer to what I'm actually looking for is: is there a way to mock an entire class (using CGLib) in one fell swoop, without specifying every method to stub out? </p>

<p>So the mock is being wrapped in a constructor, so obviously methods can be called on it, is JMock capable of dynamically mocking out each method? </p>

<p>My guess is no, as that would be pretty complicated. But knowing I'm barking up the wrong tree is valuable too :-)</p>

<p>We have a set of business objects that query a couple of back end databases that is developed with Linq to SQL. The SQL that gets generated is relatively dynamic (based on the conditions the user selects) and involves multiple joins, some inner, some outer, etc.  Linq to SQL worked great for this.  However, we ran into issues when we tried to implement reports with SQL Reporting Services after the initial roll out.  We didn't have the ability to bind the SSRS reports to our business layer.  What we essentially ended up doing is getting the SQL that is executed from SQL Profiler and creating stored procedures, and using the stored procedures in the reports.  As one can imagine, this became a problem as we maintained the code, needing to update both our business layer and the stored procedure.</p>

<p>I have done some looking and I see that Custom Data Extensions appear to be an approach to do this. Is this the solution to the problem? Does anyone have a better approach? Are there any example of implementing a solution like this using LINQ?</p>

<p>I am asking what good profiling tools or libraries or add-ons there are for measuring actual execution of Javascript (specifically jQuery), insofar as improving actual user experience goes.  For example, measuring the time from click to visible result on-screen, or helping to determine why a jQuery-based hover effect has slow responsiveness.</p>

<p>We are noticing that when the page/DOM grows relatively large (say, 70kb to 150kb worth of HTML, excluding external CSS, JS and images), and/or has very deep nesting (14-25 levels from &lt;body&gt; to deepest tag), jQuery events fire more slowly, or the whole JS user experience gets sluggish.</p>

<p>I also have googled and learned about best practices for selectors (e.g. selecting by id is much faster than selecting with classes), I will be implementing these practices.  However, once all jQuery is fully loaded, and all events hooked, we still need to improve the actual event firing and execution.</p>

<p>I have implemented some event delegation already, and I do get the sense that having fewer hooked DOM elements makes things slightly better, but the overall experience still needs improvement with large pages.  I should mention that, since the site is AJAX heavy (lots is loaded via AJAX as opposed to initial HTTP hit), we are making heavy use of livequery instead of the plain jQuery event hooks.  I should also mention that we are slightly more focused on IE(7+) performance, but also require good Firefox performance.</p>

<p>As I develop and make changes, I figure I need a way to measure speeds pre- and post-change, so I can have concrete numbers on whether or not a change improves anything.</p>

<p>My question really is why the need for <code>RouteValueDictionary</code> ... I know you can't just cast the <code>htmlAttributes</code> to <code>IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code> ... though I'm not sure why and that might be where I'm confused.  Shouldn't <code>RouteValueDictionary</code> be to do with Routing and therefore nothing to do with HtmlHelper methods?  Like I say, I'm probably missing the point so I'd be glad if someone could tell me what I've missed.</p>

<p>Cheers...</p>

<p>edit: in response to Dan's answer --></p>

<p>I was just following what I had seen in use in the mvc source code for input helpers... </p>

<ul>
<li>see ""<code>src\SystemWebMvc\Mvc\Html\InputExtensions.cs</code>""</li>
</ul>

<p>It does as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public static string TextBox(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper, 
                             string name, 
                             object value, 
                             object htmlAttributes)
{
    return TextBox(htmlHelper, 
                   name, 
                   value,
                   new RouteValueDictionary(htmlAttributes))
}

In eclipse we have a load of referenced libraries and I know how to get them to work when we run the jar on the PDA because we have a .lnk file where you can add the external libraries simply by adding the following:</p>

<pre><code>512#""\J9\PPRO11\bin\j9.exe"" -jcl:ppro11 -cp ""\dist\WiFiTest.jar;\placelab\lib\placelab.jar"" j2medemo.wifi.WiFiTest

<p>Adding whatever libraries we need after the -cp argument.  However, I have no idea how to replicate this in the ant file (no idea is actually an exaggeration but after reading all the documentation I <em>still</em> don't understand it).</p>

<p>We have the following .</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""jar"" depends=""prepare""&gt;

<p>Secondly, we have a run target:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""run"" description=""run"" depends=""jar""&gt;

    &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I wanted to change it to run a different class so I created the following two targets:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""jarSAX"" depends=""prepare""&gt;
 &lt;delete file=""${dist}/SAXParse.jar""/&gt;
 &lt;delete file=""${dist}/MANIFEST.MF""/&gt;

&lt;/target&gt;

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""runSAXParser"" description=""run"" depends=""jarSAX""&gt;

        &lt;/exec&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;

<p>But if I try and run this I get the following error:</p>

<p>This works in principle, but after some time the channel times out. It seems that there are some fundamental issues with long-running connections (see

<p>Edit: Even with a 2 hour timeout the channel is eventually compromised. I get this error:</p>

<p>The operation 'SignalSpeedData' could not be completed because the sessionful channel timed out waiting to receive a message.  To increase the timeout, either set the receiveTimeout property on the binding in your configuration file, or set the ReceiveTimeout property on the Binding directly. </p>

<pre><code>        //populate and set the selected item for locations.
        var locationSelect = document.createElement(""select"");
        var arrayLocations = ('R:Rochester;MA:Massachusetts;DL:Data Librarian;Buff:Buffalo/Niagara Falls;Bing :Binghamton / Owego / Southern Tier;Other:All other locations;Alb:Albany and all points East;').split("";"");
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; arrayLocations.length - 1; i++) {
            var optionItem = document.createElement(""option"");
            optionItem.value = trim(arrayLocations[i].split("":"")[0]);
            optionItem.text = trim(arrayLocations[i].split("":"")[1]);
            //check if this should be the selected item.
            if (arrayLocations[i].indexOf(rowData.Location) != -1)
                optionItem.selected = true;
            locationSelect.add(optionItem);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>but there should be a way to grab the entire dom element from jqGrid.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

I've been looking at a few PHP framework recently, and it came down to two. The Zend Framework or CodeIgniter. </p>

<p>I prefer CodeIgniter, because of its simple design. It's very bare bone, and it is just kept simple. The thing I don't like though is the weak template system. The template system is important for me, because I will be working with another designer. Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>

<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis ""loose coupling between modules"", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any ""gotchas"" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here?</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Based on help from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/20654/oscar-reyes"">Oscar Reyes</a>, I crafted this solution:</p>

<pre><code>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class MyApp extends JFrame {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        new MyApp();
    }

    public MyApp() {
        super(""MyApp"");
        setUndecorated(true);
        setVisible(true);
        setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        String i = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, ""Enter your name:"", getTitle(), JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE);
        if(null != i) {
            JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, ""Your name is:"", getTitle(), JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE, null, null, i.concat(i));
        }
        dispose();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice I display my output in a JOptionPane.showInputDialog also.  This way the output is highlighted in a text field so I can simply press <KBD>CTRL</KBD>+<KBD>C</KBD> to copy the output to the system clipboard and them press <KBD>ESC</KBD> to dismiss the application.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've created a trivial GUI for my trivial application.  My application prompts for a single input with a <code>JOptionPane.showInputDialog</code>, performs a calculation, and then displays a single output  with a <code>JOptionPane.showMessageDialog</code>.  I sometimes switch to a maximized browser window or something else to copy from, and then want to switch back to my JOptionPane dialog to paste into.</p>

<p>I want to have my JOptionPane dialog show up as a task on the taskbar so I could switch to it like nearly any other running program.  I prefer JOptionPane's simplicity, rather than having to create a JFrame, a FlowLayout, an Icon, a JTextField, a JButton, an ActionListener, and so on, and so on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can JOptionPane show up as a task on the taskbar?</li>
<li>If so, how do I get it to show up?</li>
<li>If not, is there anything else that's a one-liner like <code>JOptionPane.show[whatever]dialog()</code>?</li>

<p>I have an ICS file. It <a href=""http://severinghaus.org/projects/icv/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">validates</a>. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN:VCALENDAR

</code></pre>

<p>I double-click it and it goes into Outlook 2007 perfectly.
Then, I double-click another ICS file that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN:VCALENDAR

</code></pre>

<p>As <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2446#page-19"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explained in the rfc</a>, the UID is the same and the sequence number is one greater, so I expect outlook to update my previous event entry, but all it does is insert a second one.</p>

<p>How can I formulate the ICS file so that Outlook knows to update the event? The original poster in the thread I referenced above said he got it to respond with METHOD and ORGANIZER but in my experience METHOD has no effect and ORGANIZER causes undesirable behavior where Outlook wants to email the event to someone. I just want it to update the calendar.</p>

<p>I have code which has - until today - run just fine on many systems and is deployed at many sites. It involves threads reading and writing data from a serial port. </p>

<p>Trying to check out a new device, my code was swamped with  995 ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED errors calling GetOverlappedResult after the ReadFile. Sometimes the read would work, othertimes I'd get this error. Just ignoring the error and retrying would - amazingly - work without dropping any data. No ClearCommError required.</p>

<p>Here's the snippet.</p>

<pre><code>if (!ReadFile(handle,&amp;c,1,&amp;read, &amp;olap))
    {
        if (GetLastError() != ERROR_IO_PENDING)
        {
            logger().log_api(LOG_ERROR,""ser_rx_char:ReadFile"");
            throw Exception(""ser_rx_char:ReadFile"");
        }
    }

    WaitForSingleObjectEx(r_event, INFINITE, true);  // alertable, so, thread can be closed correctly.

    if (GetOverlappedResult(handle,&amp;olap,&amp;read, TRUE) != 0)
    {
        if (read != 1)
            throw Exception(""ser_rx_char: no data"");

        logger().log(LOG_VERBOSE,""read char %d ( read = %d) "",c, read);
    }
    else
    {
        DWORD err = GetLastError();
        if (err != 995)   //Filters our ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED
        {
            logger().log_api(LOG_ERROR,""ser_rx_char: GetOverlappedResult"");

<p>My first guess is to blame the COM port driver, which I havent' used before (it's a RS422 port on a Blackmagic Decklink, FYI), but that feels like a cop-out. </p>
